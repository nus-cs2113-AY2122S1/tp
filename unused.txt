## Introduction
Restaurant Buddy is a desktop application designed for restaurant managers to help **keep track of restaurant data**
such as its employees, dishes in the menu and ingredients in storage via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
In particular, Restaurant Buddy was developed specifically for users who can type fast and prefer typing to other
means of input.

## Purpose
This user guide is designed for managers (or employees undertaking managerial roles) who oversee operations
at a restaurant. This user guide provides the necessary information on how to utilise Restaurant Buddy
to its fullest potential. There is little to no prior technical knowledge needed, everything you need to get
started will be included in the next section under "How To Use". However, a simple understanding of how
a restaurant runs is assumed.

## How To Use
Restaurant Buddy is a Command-Line-Interface (CLI) application. This means that the interaction between you
and the application is purely through a single line of words. In order to do a desired action, simply type in the
command according to a specified format and press enter on your keyboard. The format of inputs that you can type
into the application is specified in the document later on from Section 2: Features onwards. These are also highlighted
throughout the user guide.

In this user guide, there are multiple references to terms like 'employee', 'dish', 'ingredient' and 'finance'.
These four terms are the key areas that Restaurant Buddy aims to help restaurant managers through. These four
terms are defined below:
- 'Employee' refers to any person working for the restaurant.
- 'Dish' refers to any individual food or beverage that is sold at the restaurant. Multiple 'dish' collated in
a single list makes up a 'menu'.
- 'Ingredient' refers to any materials that is used to create a 'dish' that is currently in storage at the restaurant.
- 'Finance' refers to the amount of money earned or spent, recorded at the end of the day or week.

In addition, there are certain conventions throughout the user guide:
- highlighted words such as `add-employee/EMPLOYEE_NAME/PHONE_NUMBER` indicates a command that can be typed onto
the command line interface
- expected output is placed inside a box such as the box below
