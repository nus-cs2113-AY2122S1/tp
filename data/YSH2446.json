{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"This special seminar identifies, examines, and explores, pathways through which individuals and organizations might champion effective â€œglobal environmental governanceâ€? strategies.\n\nTo accomplish this task the course is organized into five session. Session I: transnational pathways, assesses how practitioners might draw on global initiatives to influence â€˜on the groundâ€™ challenges in domestic settings. Session II identifies â€˜bottom upâ€™ path dependent policy interventions capable of gaining strength over time, and spreading outward. The course will apply these pathway frameworks to globally relevant forest and climate challenges including C02 emissions, deforestation, and forest degradation. We will focus specifically on understanding how international cooperation over climate in general, and the December 2015 Paris climate agreementâ€™s emphasis on â€œNationally Developed Contributionsâ€? in particular.","title":"Global Environmental Governance: Pathways for Sustainable Outcomes","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,12,0,0,24],"moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2446","semesterData":[]}
