In this Junior Seminar, students will be exploring various ways of thinking about the relationship between the â€˜technicalâ€™ and the â€˜humanâ€™. What can these tell us about the organization of social life, and how (if at all) do they contribute to the design of â€˜betterâ€™ technologies? A central role will be reserved for ethnographic studies of technologyâ€?inâ€?use â€“ an\nacademic approach that has gained traction with industry over the past decades. Students will also acquire handsâ€?on experience of this approach by\nstudying technologyâ€?inâ€?use among friends, in the home, in the College/University, or workplace.","title":"Jr Sem Special Topics: Humanising Technology","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1112A","semesterData":[]}
