{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"From Shakespeareâ€™s Shylock to Kafkaâ€™s Gregor Samsa, Lu Xunâ€™s Ah-Q and Sinhaâ€™s Animal, it could be said that â€œrejectsâ€? abound in literature. This module is an inquiry into the affective forces of such literary rejects, such as their ability to generate empathy within both readers and other textual characters, or to elicit from the latter a sense of â€œpoeticâ€? justice beyond existing juridicial norms, as well as how they complicate the literary â€œIâ€? or subject. Texts read in the module will include Shakespeareâ€™s Merchant of Venice, Kafkaâ€™s â€œMetamorphosis,â€? Lu Xunâ€™s â€œThe Real Story of Ah-Q,â€? and Indra Sinhaâ€™s Animal People.","title":"Literary Rejects","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"EN5248R","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[]}
