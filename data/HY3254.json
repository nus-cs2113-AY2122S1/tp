{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"No one can say that the Cold War has ended yet in East Asia. But rather a number of the contemporary intraâ€?regional tensions in East Asia stem from the Cold War era; from the tensions over the Taiwan Straits, to the temporary ceaseâ€?fire status between North and South Korea, to the constitutional controversy in Japan.
