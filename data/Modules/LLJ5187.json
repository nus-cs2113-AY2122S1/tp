{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Philosophical Foundations of Contract Law invites students to critically examine (1) the theoretical underpinnings of contract law at the level of meta theory (e.g. autonomy, reliance, promise, economic, property), but also (2) at the level of foundational concepts such as ‘autonomy’, ‘freedom’, ‘the intention of the parties’, ‘vitiation’ and ‘expectation interest’; (3) how the theories help us to explain different aspects of contract law. Students should be able to engage in normative analysis of the law (how the law should be) with a view to desirable law reform. It complements the modules Advanced Contract Law and Property Theory.","title":"Philosophical Foundations of Contract Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
