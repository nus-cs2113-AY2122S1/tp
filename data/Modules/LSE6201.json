{"moduleCode":"LSE6201","title":"Biofilm Processes","description":"Study of biofilms in a variety of natural and engineered\nsystems. The emphasis will be on understanding unique\ncharacteristics and on critically evaluating old and new\nbiofilm literature. We will formulate and test working\nhypotheses regarding development of biofilms, spatial\nstructure (“architecture”), existence of steady states, and\nthe determining factors for biofilm function as well as\nadhesion and detachment. Specific examples include\nquantitative characterization of processes occurring in\nbiofilm reactors for the treatment of water and wastewater.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Integrative Science and Engineering Program","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"Prospective students should have a firm knowledge of\nmicrobiology, algebra and calculus. A basic understanding\nof molecular biology would be helpful. No advanced\ncalculus is required.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
