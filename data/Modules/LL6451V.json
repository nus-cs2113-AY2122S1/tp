{"moduleCode":"LL6451V","title":"An Uncensored History of International Law","description":"This course will focus on some of the neglected historical aspects of international law, but also on the techniques of doing a “history” of the discipline (how is one even to attempt a history (or histories) of Euro-centric international law?). It will concentrate on topics as diverse as territorial acquisition and religious authority (the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas), on the freedom of the oceans and the slave trade, on colonies and race. The course will also be of particular interest to modalities of accountability for the international legal past, such as the 2000 Women’s International Tribunal on Sexual Violence and the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice in the Chagos Archipelago.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","preclusion":"LL4451 / LL5451 / LL6451 / LLJ5451 An Uncensored History \nof International Law","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
