{"moduleCode":"MUH5202","title":"Music in Interconnection","description":"This module explores music as a locus of interaction: how it is situated in and relates to the wider world outside the concert hall, both in the abstract and in the real world. Music, like any other discipline, has both intrinsic and extrinsic connections to other fields, and adopting a multidisciplinary approach to music can lead to exciting and impactful results. Through both contemporary and historical case studies, each week of this module will critically consider the interconnection between music and another field, including areas within the arts (theatre, visual art etc.) and without (nature, gender studies, politics etc.).","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"This module is restricted to students enrolled in the Master of Music Leadership degree programme, those pursuing the Graduate Certificate in Music Perspectives and Practices, and CET learners.","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
