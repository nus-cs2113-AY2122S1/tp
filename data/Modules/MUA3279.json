{"moduleCode":"MUA3279","title":"Keyboard Literature: Sonatas in Context","description":"The genre of the sonata has a rich history and comprises a significant portion of the repertoire available to pianists. This module explores various meanings and incarnations of the keyboard sonata, approaching works from historical, sociological, and theoretical perspectives, and including both works that traditionally appear in the repertory and those that do not. Students will think critically about the genre and the larger conceptual issues surrounding it, acquire and apply analytic tools to understand and reflect upon the works studied, and emerge with a fuller picture of keyboard sonatas and a curiosity to continue discovering and rediscovering this repertoire.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"YSTCM Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"BMus students, and non-YST NUS students who are able to read Western Classical music notation fluently (particularly in bass and treble clefs) and have fundamental knowledge of music theory (minimum of approximately ABRSM Grade 5 in Music Theory or equivalent, including basic understanding of keys, triads in root position and in inversion, and cadences).
