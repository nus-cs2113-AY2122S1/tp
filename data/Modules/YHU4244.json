{"moduleCode":"YHU4244","title":"Global Microhistory","description":"This course introduces students to a new methodological approach to the writing of history that has become increasingly popular in the last ten years . Microhistories uses the lives of ordinary people who were caught up in extraordinary events to narrate broader histories. By focusing on individuals, the microhistory personalizes the past and makes it accessible for a larger audience beyond academia. In this course, we will explore the strengths of this new method and genre. We will compare the microhistory with the biography and historical fiction. We will consider what this mode of historical analysis can accomplish and discuss its limitations. At the end of the course, students will experiment with writing their own global microhistories.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules and at least one module in History.
