{"moduleCode":"SC6228","title":"Social Stratification and Mobility","description":"All human societies classify their members into categories that carry significant social meaning. A primary interest in sociology is stratification, which considers hierarchical social structures that rank people with respect to access to resources, and how such structure varies with space and time and enables individuals to move through different ranks over time at varying speed. This module will examine the concepts, methods, and facts in major literature about: class structure, intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status, factors that affect an individual’s socioeconomic achievement and social inequality. Students will study in greater depth specific situations in some Asian countries.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Sociology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
