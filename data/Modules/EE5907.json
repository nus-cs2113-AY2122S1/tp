{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"EE5907R, EE5026 or EE5027","description":"Pattern recognition deals with automated classification, identification, and/or characterizations of signals/data from various sources. The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip students with knowledge of common statistical pattern recognition (PR) algorithms and techniques. Course will contain project-based work involving use of PR algorithms. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to analyze a given pattern recognition problem, and determine which standard technique is applicable, or be able to modify existing algorithms to engineer new algorithms to solve the problem. Topics covered include: Decision theory, Parameter estimation, Density estimation, Non-parametric techniques, Supervised learning, Dimensionality reduction, Linear discriminant functions, Clustering, Unsupervised learning, Feature extraction and Applications.","title":"Pattern Recognition","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[2.75,0,0,2,5.25],"prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] (EE2012 / EE2012A / ST2334 / ST1131 / ST2131 / CE2407 / CE2407A / BN2102 or equivalent) AND EE3731C AND (CS1010E / CS1010 / CS1010S / CS1010X / IT1007 / CS1101S or equivalent).
