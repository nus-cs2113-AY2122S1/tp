{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods widely used for classification. An SVM discriminates between two classes by generating a decision boundary that optimally separates classes after transforming the input data into a high-dimensional space. SVMs are popular because they are memory efficient and can address a large number of predictor variables. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement SVMs, and assess their performance. The versatility of SVMs is demonstrated through practical applications.","title":"Learning from Data: Support Vector Machines","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","workload":[5,4,0,6,5],"prerequisite":"Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice","moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"DSA5842","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1900","endTime":"2030","weeks":{"start":"2021-08-10","end":"2021-11-16"},"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":60,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}],"prereqTree":"DSA5831"}
