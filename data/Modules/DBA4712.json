{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Machine learning is often used to find the association of two events. For example, the frequency of hospital visits is strongly negatively correlated with life expectancy. Such strong associations might lead to non-sensible decisions like not seeing a doctor when one is sick. Beyond the warning â€œcorrelation is not causation,â€? we need a systematic way to disentangle correlation from causation. \n \nThis course will apply causal analytics to a wide range of managerial decisions, such as what makes government leaders confident that a COVID-19 vaccine is effective, what business policy boosts the economy, and which advertisement recommendation algorithm generates higher revenue.","title":"Causal Analytics for Managerial Decisions","department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[3,0,0,6,3],"prerequisite":"DAO1704 Decision Analytics using Spreadsheets\nDBA3803 Predictive Analytics in Business","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"DBA4712","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1200","endTime":"1500","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ2-B104","day":"Thursday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":65,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]},{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"A1","startTime":"1500","endTime":"1800","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"BIZ1-0202","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Sectional Teaching","size":60,"covidZone":"B"}],"covidZones":["B"]}],"prereqTree":{"or":["DAO1704","DBA3803"]}}
