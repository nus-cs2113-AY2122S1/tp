{"moduleCode":"ULT2299F","title":"Close Reading and Its Vicissitudes","description":"What are the possibilities and problems of “close reading”? Close reading has long been a foundational tool in, and beyond, literary studies. By looking at its formalist manifestations and political uses, this module first explores what close reading is. We then discuss recent critiques, which has led to alternatives such as: distant reading; reparative reading; surface reading; thin description; just reading; and too-close reading. In so doing, the module raises bigger questions about the “proper function” of analysis. Should it expose and uncover, or “merely” describe? To make small claims (about a literary work), or large ones (e.g., about society)?","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
