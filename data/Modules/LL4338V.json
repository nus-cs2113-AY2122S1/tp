{"moduleCode":"LL4338V","title":"Advanced Practicum in International Arbitration","description":"This course introduces students to the real-life practice of international commercial and treaty arbitration from beginning to end: from clause drafting/treaty jurisdiction, to arbitrator selection, to emergency proceedings, through the written and hearing phases, to award and enforcement strategy.  Emphasis will be on primary materials:  case law, statutes, institution rules, treaties, commentary, and “soft law” guidelines.  Using complex factual scenarios, students will take part in strategy, drafting and advocacy exercises.  On the commercial arbitration side, the focus will be on the ICC Court and SIAC; on the treaty side, ICSID and the PCA/UNCITRAL.  Ethics issues will be front burner.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"FoL Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent. \nLL4029/LL5029/LC5262/LL6029; \nLL4029V/LL5029V/LC5262V/LL6029V International \nCommercial Arbitration; OR \nLL4285/LL5285/LC5285/LL6285; \nLL4285V/LL5285V/LC5285V/LL6285V International \nDispute Settlement; OR their equivalent at another university","preclusion":"LL4338/LL5338/LL6338 Advanced Practicum in International Arbitration","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":2,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1500,"endTime":1800,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":13}]}]}
