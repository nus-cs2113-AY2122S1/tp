{"acadYear":"2021/2022","preclusion":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","description":"Lifeforms on Earth interact with each other and their surroundings to form an inter-dependent, self-regulating complex system that perpetuates the conditions for the survival of all living things. Anthropogenic perturbations, however, may risk an irreversible upset to the balance of this system. Preventing this will thus require humanity to operate sustainably, within the limits of the natural world. For this module, we shall explore the extent of human impacts and their implications for the continuation of life on Earth. Thereafter, we shall consider potential solutions that support development that promotes the well-being of present and future generations.","title":"Special Topics: Sustainability","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","workload":[0,3,0,3,4],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"UTC1112G","semesterData":[]}
