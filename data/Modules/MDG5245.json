Pre and Post synaptic  mechanisms of neurotransmission.\n3. Taxonomy of memory and functions of different brain areas  for the formation , storage and retrieval of memory.\n4. Synaptic Plasticity  and its mechanisms  for  short and long-term memory  formation.\n5. Molecular mechanisms of memory.\n6. Disorders of brain function and memory.","title":"Neuronal Signaling and  mechanisms of effective Learning","department":"NUS Medicine Dean's Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","workload":[3,0,0,7,0],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MDG5245","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[],"covidZones":[]}]}
