It takes studentsâ€™ lived experience and encounters with leaders as starting points; and considers what the literature, experts, and leaders from different domains may have said/demonstrated about leadership. The stories and examples of leadership are drawn from multiple domains (e.g. politics, education, social enterprise, business).
