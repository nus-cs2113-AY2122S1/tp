In the late 19th century, innovations such as the telephone, automobile (internal-combustion engine), and electricity have ushered in the 2nd industrial revolution with explosive growth due to rapidly lowering costs, while unleashing demand across multiple sectors.  The 3rd industrial revolution with the ubiquitous access of information technology and smartphones and the internet created new technology giants and brought innovations as a value creation driver to the forefront.  Today, especially with post-COVID, digitization and newly emergent technologies will usher in a new growth curve.
