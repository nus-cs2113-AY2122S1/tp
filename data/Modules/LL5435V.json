Rather, it has roots in almost every type of law. Through diverse readings, deep discussions, and independent research, this course will identify and understand the various types of law that, together, give rise to â€œenvironmental law.â€? The course will consider environmental lawâ€™s roots in common law, regulation, legislation, constitutions, international cooperation, public action, and even private self-governance. Though not exclusively, the focus will be on common law jurisdictions in the British tradition, but independent research will allow students to explore more widely for themselves.","title":"Foundations of Environmental Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","workload":[0,3,0,0,7],"prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"LL5435V","semesterData":[]}
