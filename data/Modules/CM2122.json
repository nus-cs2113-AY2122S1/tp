{"moduleCode":"CM2122","title":"Organic Chemistry in Life and Medicine","description":"This module will take an in-depth view of organic chemistry through the lens of structure and synthesis of biomolecules, natural products, and pharmaceuticals. Using structures and reactivities exhibited by important molecules in Life and in Medicine, students will learn, refresh and cement key concepts in organic chemistry, particularly reactions involving polar mechanisms, and acquire knowledge and hands-on experience in molecular and structural characterization, while at the same time appreciating the intrinsic relevance of organic chemistry in our existence and daily lives.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry – The Central Science","preclusion":"CM1121 Organic Chemistry 1, CM1501 Organic Chemistry for Engineers, CM2121 Organic Chemistry 2","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
