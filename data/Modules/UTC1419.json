{"moduleCode":"UTC1419","title":"Jr Sem: Inside the Museum: Collections and the Public","description":"This module looks at museums as spaces for organising, classifying, and exhibiting objects, from natural history to art. What is a museum’s relation to the public, and its functions in society?\n\nAgainst this backdrop, an interdisciplinary approach is applied to learn how and why museums came to be, their role through the ages, and how to meaningfully appreciate/critique an exhibit. The ethics and politics of decolonising museums and repatriation will be discussed.\n\nThe module will include at least one trip to local museums, and a group project where they apply aspects of their knowledge to create a public exhibition.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","preclusion":"All other UTCP Junior Seminars\nUTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17%","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
