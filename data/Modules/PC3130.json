{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module continues from PC2130 and completes the basic formation of the student in quantum mechanics. Description of composite systems: tensor product, two-particle entanglement; systems of N identical particles. Perturbation theory: time-independent, both non-degenerate and degenerate; example: Zeeman effect. Time-dependent: Fermi golden rule; example: atom in a classical e-m field. Discussion of stimulated and spontaneous emission.\nOther approximation schemes: the variational principle; the WKB approximation and the â€œclassicalâ€? region, tunneling and the connecting formula; the adiabatic approximation. Scattering: partial wave analysis and the Born approximation.","title":"Quantum Mechanics II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,0,6],"prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC2130 or PC2130B, and PC2134 or equivalent","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"PC3130","attributes":{"mpes1":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Wednesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"},{"classNo":"1","startTime":"1000","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_B","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":120,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"],"examDate":"2021-12-02T01:00:00.000Z","examDuration":120}],"prereqTree":{"and":[{"or":["PC2130","PC2130B"]},"PC2134"]},"fulfillRequirements":["PC5201","PC5203","PC5210","PC5228","PC3243","PC4130","PC4245","PC4246","PC4259","PC4230","PC4228","QT5101","QT5201V"]}
