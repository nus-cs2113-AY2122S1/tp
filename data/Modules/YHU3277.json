{"moduleCode":"YHU3277","title":"Objects of Desire: Consumers, Colonialism, and Global Trade","description":"How has our desire for consumable goods and objects, from sugar and spice to textiles and furniture, shaped world history? In this course, we will explore how the European quest for foreign items, exotic tastes, and intoxicating substances drove exploration, trade, and colonialism during the early modern era. This insatiable pursuit led to the discovery of the Americas, the growth of the Atlantic slave trade, and the development of a globalized marketplace that connected the “East” with the “West.” In this course, we will study key historical transformations that created the world we live in today: the “marketplace revolution,” the “birth” of consumer culture and the middle class, the origins of capitalism, and the emergence of modernity itself. We will do so through the prism of the consumable goods and material artefacts that drove these changes. We will explore how these substances were produced, trafficked, consumed, politicised, and aestheticized in the context of broader social processes.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","preclusion":"YHU2229 Drug Empires","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1430,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Friday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18},{"classNo":"1","startTime":1300,"endTime":1430,"venue":"Y-CR16","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Seminar-Style Module Class","size":18}]}]}
