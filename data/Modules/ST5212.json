{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Survival analysis uses time-to-event data to make inferences about survival, default and attrition. It can be used to evaluate the survival time of patients who have undergone treatment, the default risk of individuals or firms and the likelihood of failure in engineering systems or of employee turnover. This approach is also referred to as reliability theory in engineering and duration analysis in economics. Students will learn key concepts such as censoring and hazard, probability models for discrete and continuous survival times, and inferential procedures including parametric and semiparametric models. Further topics include competing risks, current status, and the frailty model.","title":"Survival Analysis","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","workload":[3,1,0,3,3],"prerequisite":"ST2132 or Departmental approval","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"ST5212","attributes":{"ssgf":true},"semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"ST2132"}
