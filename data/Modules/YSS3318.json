{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This course is primarily devoted to a close reading of Simone de Beauvoirâ€™s The Second Sex. It offers students the opportunity to engage in a rigorous reading of this text to understand her analysis of the Western philosophical and historical construction of â€œWoman.â€? This course will examine her understanding of how the Western patriarchy works via social norms and economic structures, but also via myths and stories about â€œWoman.â€? We will also explore her critical engagements with Marxism, Hegelianism, psychoanalysis, and Existentialism.  We will then read her work, The Ethics of Ambiguity, to understand her unique contribution to ethical philosophy.","title":"The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3318","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":"YCC2121"}
