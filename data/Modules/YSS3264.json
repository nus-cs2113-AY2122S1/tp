{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Financial markets are subject to periodic bouts of â€œirrational exuberanceâ€? that lead to bubbles in asset prices, frequently followed by a crash. These afflict particularly stock and foreign exchange markets and the banking industry. Despite repeated attempts to regulate finance, crises recur with remarkable frequency and regularity. In â€œThis Time is Differentâ€?, Ken Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart document eight centuries of financial folly. These crises have profound effects on the real economy, leaving a legacy of unemployment and slow growth. We use economic analysis to study several financial, foreign exchange, and banking crises in their historical and social contexts.","title":"Bubbles, Crashes, Panics and Crises","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"YSS1203 Principles of Economics or YSS2203 Intermediate Microeconomics or YSS2214 Intermediate Macroeconomics or with the permission of the instructor.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"YSS3264","semesterData":[],"prereqTree":{"or":["YSS1203","YSS2203","YSS2214"]}}
