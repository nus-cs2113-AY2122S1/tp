{"moduleCode":"LA5302","title":"Landscape Construction II","description":"This module is consist of two parts.\nThe first part emphasizes landscape engineering techniques focused on designing landscape elements for urban stormwater management (water sensitive urban design, WSUD). These WSUD elements include design of bioswales, bioretention systems and constructed wetland constructions. The course will cover fundamentals in hydrology and hydraulics, application of the knowledge for design of WSUD, including sizing, material specifications and construction and design considerations, and proficiency in production of construction drawings. \nThe second part provide informative knowledge on how design proposals are developed as professional drawings, how they are constructed, and operated in professional landscape architecture practice. It will give an overview of the nature of a professionalism that requires the active integration of related design fields. The course will clarify the responsibilities of landscape architects within the design team, as well as among different stakeholder groups, including clients, users, landscape contractors, managers, and policy makers. It will also cover office and project management, contract procedures, construction administration, ethics, and different types of oral and written communication skills for professional practice.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Architecture","faculty":"Design and Environment","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":true,"mpes2":false,"su":false},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":800,"endTime":1000,"venue":"","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":30}]}]}
