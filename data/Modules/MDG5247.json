{"moduleCode":"MDG5247","title":"Bio-Imaging: Advanced Tools and Applications","description":"This module will introduce principles and applications of novel and evolving imaging technologies relevant to biological applications. Elucidation of molecular and structural characteristics of living cells with a focus on Microbiology and Immunology will be addressed through different techniques such as correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), ultra-microscopy, Confocal Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Holotomography (HT), Super Resolution Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), AFM- Infrared Radiation Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM). This module will integrate didactic lectures, seminars and tutorials to introduce theory and applications of the above-mentioned techniques across disciplines of biology, bio-engineering and medicine.","moduleCredit":2.0,"department":"NUS Medicine Dean\u0027s Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"examDuration":0,"timetable":[]}]}
