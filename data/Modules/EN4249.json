{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module seeks a critical understanding of the term â€œautotheoryâ€? (The Argonauts, 2015). It asks: What does the â€œautoâ€? in the term imply? Does it signal a\nregression to the Self/Subject as already critiqued by theory in the 1980s? Or is it a reflection of a narcissism made possible today by social media apparatuses? Or\nelse, does it pave the way for a new â€œcare for the selfâ€? (Foucault)? And how does it influence our readings of contemporary autofiction, and vice versa? Writers\nread in this module include Maggie Nelson, Paul Preciado, Yiyun Li, Rachel Cusk, and Ottessa Moshfegh.","title":"Autotheory and Contemporary Autofiction","department":"English Language and Literature","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[0,3,0,0,9.5],"prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","moduleCredit":"5","moduleCode":"EN4249","semesterData":[]}
