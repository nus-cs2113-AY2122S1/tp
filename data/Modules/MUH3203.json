{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module traces the history of opera from its origins in Ancient Greece, through the creation of â€œmodern operaâ€? in the Renaissance, the musical theatre plays staged on Broadway and Londonâ€™s West End, and on to the musical films of Hollywood and the current opera scene in Singapore and Southeast Asia.  While at the core of the module is the thread of history which traces the evolution and development of the musical stage, a significant focus is the social and political attitudes which are reflected in the stories and the music.  From a celebration of gods and superheroes, to contemporary political events, and on to the mundane lives of ordinary people (and their pets), the module looks at how this art form has fomented political uprising and social revolution and how it has been affected by advances in technology, from electricity to social media and beyond.  Students enrolling on this module need a working knowledge of basic musical terminology but no other specialist musical knowledge is required.","title":"The Evolution of Music for the Stage","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MUH3203","attributes":{"mpes2":true},"semesterData":[]}
