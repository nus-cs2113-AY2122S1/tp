{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"This module will provide students with an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of infectious diseases in general, followed by a focus on current research methods being used and discussions on infectious disease-related research ethics. Field trip visits (pending COVID-19 restrictions) to the investigational medicine unit are being planned to allow students the opportunity to understand infectious disease-related clinical research.\n\nThe course is designed for entering M.Sc. or Ph.D. students in their first year, to help provide perspective for their choice of labs and basic concepts that will be useful for their future thesis work. Topics include, viruses; bacteria; parasites and fungi with integration of molecular pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, disease physiology/pathology, innate & adaptive immunity and laboratory models of infectious disease and treatment challenges discussed throughout each pathogen family. Other topics include epidemiology and global health and research ethics related to infectious disease. In addition, there will be interactive sessions for students to strengthen communication and presentation skills through debates and journal club presentations.","title":"Infectious Diseases: Principles & Research Methods","department":"NUS Medicine Dean's Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"MDG5246","semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[],"covidZones":[]}]}
