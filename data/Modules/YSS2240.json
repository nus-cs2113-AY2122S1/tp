{"moduleCode":"YSS2240","title":"Women and Work around the World","description":"This introductory course will study the global gender gap in the arena of work in both rich and poor countries. It will introduce students to the dynamic relationship between gender and work across time and space, investigating why only certain types of work are considered “real work” in certain parts of the world, women’s growing entry into the formal sector, the feminization of certain types of labour, the stigmatized nature of domestic work, women’s labour movements, and the role played by women’s work in international development. Readings will be drawn from sociology, anthropology, labour studies, geography, and economics.","moduleCredit":5.0,"department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","acadYear":"2021/2022","semesterData":[]}
