{"moduleCode":"GEM2905X","title":"Singapore as ‘Model’ City?","description":"A ‘global city’, a ‘city in a garden’, a ‘city of 6.9 million’... what do these and other models say about Singapore and its relationship to its past and future? This course facilitates critical and multi?disciplinary engagement with the imagination and organization of Singapore as city. Students will examine visible aspects of the urban environment together with what is (treated as) invisible, and explore what is at stake in meeting Singapore’s ambition within its borders and beyond. The module culminates in a project that allows students to situate ideals of the liveable, sustainable, inclusive (etc.) city in particular urban sites.","moduleCredit":4.0,"department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","preclusion":"GEM2902% or GEM2905% or GEM2907% or GEM2908% or GEM2909% or GEM2910% or UTC21% or UTS2105 or SSU2004%","acadYear":"2021/2022","attributes":{"mpes1":false,"mpes2":false,"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
