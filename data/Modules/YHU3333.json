{"acadYear":"2021/2022","description":"Between the 5th and 10th of June 1967 Israel fought the combined forces of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Israeliâ€™s swift victory not only gained them territory but shocked a transnational Arab population whose leaders had announced their military success even as their forces were decimated. â€œThe setback,â€? as it was called, was â€œa total defeat of regimes, institutions, structures, ideas, and leadersâ€? that upended Arabic intellectual and cultural production. This course begins with the war but then focuses on its aesthetic afterlives to ask: how does one create art in the face of total defeat?","title":"The Arab Defeat of 1967 and its Aesthetic Afterlives","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":[0,3,0,3,6.5],"prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
