{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"The central theme of this course is what to measure and how to measure, when assessing the effects of marketing tactics. Evaluation and control are essential strategic marketing processes and the basis of evaluation and control is measurement. We will examine such questions as:\nâ€¢ How to measure customer satisfaction and brand attitudes?\nâ€¢ How much will sales have to increase to justify expanding the sales force?\nâ€¢ What will be the effect on total firm profit from eliminating the poorest performing customers? \nâ€¢ What is the lifetime value of a customer?\nâ€¢ How will a price cut affect sales?\nâ€¢ How can conjoint analysis be used to evaluate new product concepts?\nâ€¢ What are the long term effects of sales promotions?\nâ€¢ What are the effects of advertising?\nThe course will also focus on performance â€œdashboardsâ€?, which allow executives to monitor, analyze and manage the business. Dashboards can be both tactical and strategic in their orientation, but always involve collecting and summarizing data, preparing key performance indicators (KPIâ€™s), and bringing this information together in a form relevant to marketing decisions on an ongoing basis.","title":"Marketing Metrics - Measuring Marketing Performance","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","workload":[0,3,0,4,3],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"BMA5529","semesterData":[]}
