{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"What does â€œChineseâ€? mean when we talk about â€œChineseâ€? language, â€œChineseâ€? culture or â€œChineseâ€? people? What is â€œChinese-nessâ€?, and what is the anthropolinguistic evidence for this? The issues and topics covered in this module will help us to address these questions. These include interpersonal communication between â€œChineseâ€? people themselves (â€œintracultural communicationâ€?); between â€œChineseâ€? people and other â€œnon-Chineseâ€? peoples (â€œintercultural communicationâ€?); and, between selected groups of â€œChineseâ€? people. This module covers a wide range of interesting real-life scenarios involving anthropological, linguistic, psychological and communicative evidence. Students will find practical use for the knowledge acquired in this module.","title":"Chinese Anthropolinguistics (taught in English)","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"CL2291","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":2,"timetable":[{"classNo":"1","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1200","weeks":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13],"venue":"E-Learn_C","day":"Tuesday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":35,"covidZone":"Unknown"}],"covidZones":["Unknown"]}]}
