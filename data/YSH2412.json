{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"A predominant pattern in Western epics has been the â€?Novel of Formationâ€?\n(Bildungsroman) â€“ the novel that follows an individual through the stages of\nher life. The last century has seen a radical reversal. Instead of narrating a\nlifeâ€™s development, the new novel concentrates on the institution that\nshapes individuals and renders them subjects (school, bureaucracy, court of\nlaw etc.). The Germanâ€?Czech writer Kafka is the master of the new genre. The\ncourse highlights Kafkaâ€™s â€œThe Trialâ€? as a â€œnovel of institutionâ€? while drawing\non related works including â€œThe Castle,â€? and exploring concepts such as\nâ€œinstitution,â€? â€œnovel,â€? â€œform of life.â€?","title":"Short Course: Franz Kafka - The Novel of Institution","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","workload":"12-24","moduleCredit":"1","moduleCode":"YSH2412","semesterData":[]}
