{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"No more adding of â€œnew mediaâ€?, media scholars have cried out over the recent years, to existing things when what we call â€œold mediaâ€? was to quip a seminal phrasing, always already new. The same can be said for the communities and publics that media helped form. As â€˜new mediaâ€™ becomes increasingly ubiquitous in popular and scholarly discourse, we have lost sight of the termâ€™s older origin as the mediation between cultures, politics, identities, and ideologies. Through media theory, literary narratives, films, and artworks, students will learn the post-hermeneutic turn in the humanities, where the idea of â€œtextâ€? is simply one of the dynamic effects of mediality.","title":"â€œNewâ€?
