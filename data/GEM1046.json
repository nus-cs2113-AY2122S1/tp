But how do we determine what we call home, and why should we take â€œhomeâ€? seriously? This module explores the political, social, economic, and cultural aspects of the complex idea of home. Major topics include: sense of place, home technologies and design, gender and housework, home and travel, globalisation,\nnationalism, homelessness, exile, and representations of home. Students will complete the module with a new appreciation for the complexity of the places â€“ house, neighborhood, nation, planet â€“ they call home.","title":"Home","department":"Japanese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","workload":[2,1,0,2,5],"moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"GEM1046","attributes":{"su":true},"semesterData":[]}
