{"acadYear":"2020/2021","description":"The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with sufficient design knowledge and skills on steelâ€?concrete composite structures in their engineering career. This module provides participants with fundamental approaches in designing structural steelâ€?concrete components and buildings. The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform structural design for composite beams, slabs, columns, joints, multiâ€?storey buildings. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system. The module is targeted at practicing engineers, postâ€?graduate civil engineering students and those with a keen interest on structural design.","title":"Design of Composite Steel and Concrete Structures to EC4","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"Engineering","workload":[1,0.5,0,0.5,3],"prerequisite":"Background in Structural Steel Design","moduleCredit":"2","moduleCode":"CE5509B","attributes":{"lab":true},"semesterData":[{"semester":1,"timetable":[{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0930","endTime":"1230","weeks":[9],"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"A"},{"classNo":"01","startTime":"0900","endTime":"1700","weeks":{"start":"2020-09-12","end":"2020-10-03"},"venue":"LT1","day":"Saturday","lessonType":"Lecture","size":40,"covidZone":"A"}],"covidZones":["A"]}]}
