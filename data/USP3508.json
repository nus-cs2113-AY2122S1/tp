As a result,\ncorporeal registersâ€” facial expressions, phenotype, movement, affective expressions, etc.â€”are now vital markers of difference, determining the degree to which one is recognized as â€˜friendâ€™ or â€˜enemyâ€™, â€˜suspectâ€™ or â€˜innocentâ€™, â€˜citizenâ€™ or â€˜foreignerâ€™. Organized around three prominently figured bodiesâ€”the tortured body, the racialized body, and the veiled bodyâ€”in the post-9/11 global landscape and its current â€œWar on Terrorâ€?, this module examines the ways in which the body is situated and implicated in relations of power, sovereignty, identity, and violence.","title":"The Politics of the Body","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","workload":"0-0-4-0-2-4","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","moduleCredit":"4","moduleCode":"USP3508","semesterData":[]}
