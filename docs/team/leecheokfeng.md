## Project: Restaurant Buddy
Restaurant Buddy is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application meant to help
restaurant managers keep track of their restaurant data. Such data includes
their employees, dishes on the menu, ingredient inventory and finances.
Restaurant Buddy is written in Java, and has about 4 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
* New Feature: Added the ability to add, remove and list ingredients.
  * What it does: This allows users to display all ingredients on their list,
  and interact with the list by adding or removing ingredients.
  * Justification: Restaurant managers need to be able to keep track and
  take stock of their ingredient inventory.


* New Feature: Added the ability to find expired ingredients in the list.
  * What it does: This allows users to find ingredients that would be expired
  by a certain input date.
  * Justification: Restaurant managers have many ingredients and may not be
  able to remember which ingredients expire by what date. This feature helps
  managers plan ahead on what ingredients they may need to stock up on.
