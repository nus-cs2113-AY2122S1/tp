## Overview

Fitbot is a desktop app that helps university students who are looking to keep track of their calorie consumption and calorie output with the speed and convenience of command-line based tools, especially in times of online school.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### **New Feature**: Add, Delete and View Upcoming Exercises in Upcoming Exercise List

- What it does: Allows user to edit items with wrong information in the Upcoming Exercise List, Food Bank and Exercise Bank.
- Justification: This feature improves the product by enabling user to change the information of the item directly, instead of having to delete and add the item again.
- Highlights: Users are only required to key in the information that needs to be changed instead of having to type out all the information again.

- What it does: Allows user to delete multiple items at once in the Upcoming Exercise List, Food Bank and Exercise Bank.
