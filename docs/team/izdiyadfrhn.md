UG Contributions
* Due to last minute changes to UserGuide.md, most of my team member's code might be attributed to Glenn (poppolette). This leads to inaccuracy of the above link, and you should view my team members' Project Portfolio Pages to get a better overview of everyone's contribution to the User Guide and Developer Guide
* Set up `Attendance` section of UserGuide.md
