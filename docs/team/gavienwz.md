#### Enhancements Implemented

**Features**
* `edit`: Allow users to edit Trips.
  * Quality of Life functionality of Traveller, that allows users to edit a Trip's start and end destination without
  the need to delete and create a new one.
  * Enhancement of edit was further made to address issue 
[#133](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/issues/133), allowing Users to edit the trip name as well as 
customisability of the command. (Being able to omit arguments that won't be edited.)

[#84](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/pull/84), 
[#163](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/pull/163).

  [manual testing.](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w13-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#6-instructions-for-manual-testing)
