## Project: Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TAA)
Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TAA) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for keeping track of classes and students.
It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
* **New Feature**: Added `Attendance` class.
    * **What it does**: Added the `Attendance` class to represent the attendance of a student.
    * **Justification**: Enables the creation of `Attendance` objects with relevant attributes.
  
* **New Feature**: Added `AttendanceList` class.
    * **What it does**: Added the `AttendanceList` class to represent the attendances of a student for lessons.
    * **Justification**: Enables the creation of `AttendanceList` objects that contains the student's attendance for 
      lessons.
* **New Feature**: Added `LessonAttendanceList` class.
   * **What it does**: Added the `LessonAttendanceList` class to represent the class attendance for a lesson.
   * **Justification**: Enables the creation of `AttendanceLessonList` objects that contains the students' attendances,
    grouped by lesson.
* **New Feature**: Added `ParseStudentIndexes` class.
   * **What it does**: Added the `ParseStudentIndexes` class to recognize multiple student index inputs.
   * **Justification**: Enables the user to input a range or a selection of student indexes.
* **New Feature**: Added `StudentIndexArray` class.
   * **What it does**: Added the `StudentIndexArray` class to store student indexes.
   * **Justification**: Enables the program to loop through the student indexes.
* **New Feature**: Added `command` classes for `Attendance` across `v1.0` - `v2.1`
   * These include: `SetAttendanceCommand`, `ListAttendanceCommand`, `ListLessonAttendanceCommand` and 
  `DeleteAttendanceCommand`.
   * **What they do**: Enable user to set, delete and view student attendance in `AttendanceList`and lesson attendance 
  in `LessonAttendanceList`. Users can also set and delete multiple attendances in one go.
  * **Justification** These commands are essential in allowing the user to set and view students' attendances to keep
   track of them.
