### Project: SEPlanner

SEPlanner is a lightweight desktop application for Computer Engineering undergraduates to plan for the Student
Exchange Programme, optimised for use via Command Line Interface (CLI).  

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `User Interface` component to handle formatting of outputs to display to the user. 
    * Added padding for different output types(Index, university and module names) to align Ui output) 
    * Formatted printing of object types within SEPlanner (University, Module, Module Mapping).

* **New Feature**: Collaboration with @mazj124 on the University and Module Mapping classes as the model for SEPlanner.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-25&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=titustortoiseturtle1999&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
