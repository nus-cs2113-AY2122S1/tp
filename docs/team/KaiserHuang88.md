## Project: Gordon

Gordon is a Command Line Interface (CLI)-based recipe manager application. It helps
users to organise a collection of recipes using various attributes. It also stores them
to a text file for future reference. It is written in Java and has around 4 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **New feature**: Added _Parser_ Class [#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/37)
    * Justification: Allows automatic parsing of user input.

* **New feature**: Added ability to add ingredients to _Recipe_. [#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/42)
    * Justification: Allows user to add modify their newly created recipe by adding ingredients.

* **New feature**: Added ability to add steps to _Recipe_. [#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/42)
    * Justification: Allows user to add modify their newly created recipe by adding steps.

* **New feature**: Added JUnit tests for _Recipe_ and _Cookbook_ classes [#276](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/276)
    * Justification: Ensures that _Recipe_ and _Cookbook_ can work even with unexpected inputs.
