### Project: UNIMods

UNIMods is a light-weight Command Line Interface (CLI) Application that provides a means for students to plan for
their academic journey in NUS. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the add module command.
    * What it does: allows the user to add modules to their timetables.
    * Justification: This feature is extremely important as it allows users to plan and organise their timetable.
    * Highlights: This feature was one of the first few features to be implemented and started off by simply adding modules into
    * a user's timetable. However, future iterations has evolved this feature into parsing module and semester data in order to 
    * display lesson information for each lesson type to allow easier selection of lesson for the module. 

* **New Feature**: Added the add event command.
    * What it does: allows the user to add personal events to their timetables.
    * Justification: This feature is extremely important as it allows users to plan and organise their school timetable and personal timetable.
    * Highlights: This feature was added in `v2.0` to enhance the functionality of the product to make it allow users to plan their timetable more effectively.

* **Project management**:
    * Managed issues for v1.0 on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
    * enhanced Add feature by notifying users of potential lesson conflicts when selecting lessons or events. This is especially important when organising timetable since overlapping lessons/events may be an oversight. [\#77](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W12-2/tp/pull/77)
