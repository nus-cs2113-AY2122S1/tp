## Overview

## Summary of Contributions
This section documents the summary of the contributions that I have done in this project.

### Code Contributed
I have contributed over 900 lines of code that is split among functional code, tests and documentation. My code can be 
found at this [link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=leeyikai)

### Enhancements Implemented
I have implemented the following enhancements

- Filtering of expenses by category, payer, description, which allows the user to search for expenses based on their
   specific requirements. 
- Payment optimization, where the number of transactions required to ensure that everyone is paid back is reduced.

### Contributions to the UG
I have contributed to these sections in the UG

- `view` section, where I have contributed most of the initial content, before my teammates helped to refine it to
    make it clearer for the users.
- `optimize` section, where I help write the explanations so that the user can have a clearer understanding of what the
   function does.

### Contributions to the DG
I have contributed to these sections in the DG

- `Expense` section, where I wrote the majority of the explanation and did up 2 diagrams, one to show the interactions
    the `Expense` and other classes and interfaces. I also did up a comprehensive sequence diagram that illustrated clearly the flow of the initialization of an `Expense`.

### Contributions to team-based tasks
I contributed in these areas for team-based tasks

- Code enhancements: I ensured that the code that people were requesting to merge in were neat, and I recommended multiple ways for the code to be neatened such as removing magic numbers/strings.

### Review/Mentoring Contributions
I contributed in review/mentoring in these areas

- I suggested ways for the code to be refactored so that our overall readability can be improved. This was largely done during our meetings.
- I thoroughly tested other team's code and gave them valuable inputs to improve their interface.
