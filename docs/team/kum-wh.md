## Overview
I was involved in the development of a greenfield project known as `mTracker`. The `mTracker` program
serves as a command-line trading journal interface that allows busy individuals to store important financial instrument.
Throughout the project development, my main responsibilities include:
* Implementing and handling bugs relenting to `Etf` instrument and adding it to the watchlist.
* Implementing and handling bugs relenting to `edit` feature.
* Implementing and handling bugs relenting to `list` feature.

## Summary of Contributions
Below are some of my contributions to the project

**Code contributed:**

The code I contributed can be found in the reposense link [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=T12-1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=functional-code~other~test-code~docs&since=2021-09-25&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=kum-wh&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2113T-T12-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=functional-code~test-code~docs&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)

**Enhancements**:
* **New Feature:** Provided the add `etf` into watchlist functionality.
  * Implemented the `add etf` functionality to allow users to
    store crypto information into `mTracker`.
  * Justification: This feature is one of the core features given that `crypto` is a widely known instrument type in
    the financial markets and is something our user would require support for.
* **New Feature:** Provided the `edit` functionality.
  * The `edit` functionality allows the user to edit a current instrument parameters
  * Justification: This is a core feature that allow users to edit current instruments they added. This allows for updates of parameters on the instruments.
  * Highlights: The `edit` functionality is required to interact with all instrument type and require requesting of inputs from user.
* **New Feature:** Provided the `list` functionality.
  * The `list` functionality allows the user to view all instruments and their general parameters.
  * Justification: This is a core feature that provide users with a way to view all their instruments they have added.
