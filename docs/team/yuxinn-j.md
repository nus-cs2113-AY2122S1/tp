## Project: Code Hunt

### Overview
Code Hunt is a text-based adventure game using command lines for children aged
4 to 9 who have little prior coding experience but have an interest in coding
to learn basic coding knowledge through playing games and collecting knowledge cards.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.
