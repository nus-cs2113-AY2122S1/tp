During the development this software, I am responsible for implement the following features:
- Adding custom food entry
- setting user gender 
- Showing weekly food intake summary
- Showing monthly food intake summary
- exit the program


## Enhancement implementation

### Adding custom food entry

- What it does: Allows the user to add and track their food intake which is not provided inside our default database
- Justification: This is one of FitNUS's core features. It is important to keep track of user daily food intake espeacially
if the user is having his/her custom food.

### Setting user gender

- What it does: Allows the user to change the gender if he/she sets it wrongly before.
- Justification: This is one of FitNUS's core features. It allows the user to modify in the event the user gives a wrong input previously.

### Remove food from daily intake

- What it does: Allows the user to delete a specified food entry.
- Justification: This is one of FitNUS's core features. As a diet tracker, it should allow the user to
  delete any food entry in the event they make any mistakes.
- Highlights: This enhancement required a good understanding of how entries are being logged in. The challenge when
  implementing this feature is to ensure that the specified entry exists, and throws the proper exception otherwise.


### View weekly entry summary

- What it does: allow users to view a concise summary of what he/she has eaten over the past seven days, including 
components of calorie trend graph, average daily calorie and most/least eaten foods.
- Highlights: This enhancement required a good understanding of how entries are being logged in. The challenge comes in
  differentiating how many entries to include in the summary. This required the use of
  `EntryDatabase#getPastDaysEntryDatabase(int)` which returns the past seven days' entries. It also needs to take into account that new users may have very few records, so FitNus 
  need to adjust the summary accordingly.



### view monthly entry summary

- What it does: allow users to view a concise summary of what he/she has eaten in the current month, including components 
of average daily calorie and most/least eaten foods.
- Highlights: This enhancement required a good understanding of how entries are being logged in. The challenge comes in
differentiating how many entries to include in the summary. This required the use of
`EntryDatabase#getPastMonthEntryDatabase()` which returns past month entries. It also needs to take into account 
that new users may have very few records, so FitNus need to adjust the summary accordingly.
