## Overview

MedBot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for head nurses to manage the personal information of patients and
medical staff and to schedule appointments between the 2 parties. By utilising text-based commands instead of Graphical
User Interface (GUI)
based navigation, MedBot allows head nurses to complete their management tasks done quicker and more efficiently.

* Enhancements implemented
    * `Storage` class (including `AppointmentStorage`, `PersonStorage`, `PatientStorage`, `StaffStorage` classes).
        * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts used: `AppointmentStorage` and `PersonStorage` inherit
          from `Storage`, and
          `PatientStorage` and `StaffStorage` inherit from `PersonStorage`.
        * These classes give MedBot the ability to persistently store and retrieve data that the user enters into the
          program, and even allows for porting of the data to other computers.
    * `StorageManager` class which consolidates the functionality of the aforementioned `Storage` classes.

* Documentations:
    * User Guide Contribution
      * Update User Guide with the latest features and expected outputs after changes in MedBot code
        * Added find appointments section 
      * Explanation for how persistent data is stored for MedBot.
      * Edits to refine certain explanations and certain edge cases
      * Added table of contents for easy navigation
    * Developer Guide Contribution
      * Section on instructions for manual testing
      * Implementation details for Storage component.
      * Sequence diagram for `Storage`.

* Review/mentoring contributions
