## Project: Restaurant Buddy

### Overview
Restaurant Buddy is a desktop application designed for restaurant managers to help **keep track of restaurant data**
such as its employees, dishes in the menu and ingredients in storage via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
In particular, Restaurant Buddy was developed specifically for users who can type fast and prefer typing to other
means of input. It is written in Java, and has about 3 kLoC.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.
- New Feature: Added a help command that allows the user to list all possible commands.
  - What it does: This command lists down all the possible commands that is accepted in the application.
  - Justification: This allows users to have a quick reference to possible commands through the CLI instead of through 
  the User Guide.
  - Highlights: This command required extensive understanding of the possible commands and is manually included towards 
  the end of the project.

- New Feature: Added the ability to interact with the list of employees.
  - What it does: These commands allow users to interact with their list of employees.
  - Justification: This enables users to keep track of important information of their employees quickly and easily.
  - Highlights: Considerable amount of research was conducted through online sources to determine the type of 
  information that is important to our target users. This enabled our application to be a better fit for them.
