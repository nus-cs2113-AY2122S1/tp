* Enhancements Implemented
  * Enhanced `AddMember` command
    * checks the data to see whether they are valid. Checks consist of valid phone number, gender, student number and 
      name. No duplicates of names, student number and phone number should occur.
  * Set up Storage component
    * Implemented `MemberStorage`, `TrainingStorage` and `AttendanceStorage` classes.
      * quite straight forward for `MemberStorage` and `TrainingStorage`.
      * `AttendanceStorage` was hard as originally our team had 1 attendance list for everything, but if the entire list 
        is a single CSV file it would be trivial and not well-designed. My implementation made it so that each training 
        name will have its own CSV file, with each attendance file having the training name as its file name. As such,
        multiple attendance files can be generated based on a single attendance list.
      * I used CSV as I was unable to implement ics file for training schedule, even after spending a few days trying to 
        figure it out. Moreover,a CSV can be open with Microsoft Excel which is available for all NUS students.
    * Verification of all the data when manually edit the CSV file.
    * Implemented a feature such that it automatically changes the relevant CSV file whenever a valid command is made.
    * Handled most exceptions in those classes mentioned above.

* UG Contributions
  * Set up `Storage` section. Mostly gives warnings about what not to do regarding Storage.

* DG Contributions
  * Set up `Storage` DeveloperGuide.md.
  * advised UML diagrams for all.
