## Features Implemented
* Set up `training` package
  * Implemented `TrainingSchedule` class
    * `TrainingSchedule` is a class that stores `TrainingName`, `TrainingVenue` and `TrainingTime`, used to identify a specific training
    * `TrainingSchedules` have _unique_ `TrainingName`, multiple `TrainingSchedule` entries cannot have the same name
    * Implemented getters and setters for `TrainingName`, `TrainingVenue` and `TrainingTime`
    * Implemented constructor for `TrainingSchedule`
    * Formatted `toString()` to be more readable
    * Continued updating class throughout implementation to keep it up-to-date
  * Implemented `TrainingList` class
    * Contains an ArrayList of `TrainingSchedules`
    * Stores all recorded `TrainingSchedules` input by user
    * Implemented method to get a specific `TrainingSchedule` from ArrayList
    * Implemented method to delete a specific `TrainingSchedule` from ArrayList via index
    * Implemented method to find for `TrainingSchedule` using a String `name` keyword
    * Implemented method to update index of `TrainingList`. Called whenever a `TrainingSchedule` is deleted
  * Implemented `AddTraining` command; allows users to add a `TrainingSchedule` to `TrainingList`
    * Checks if entry to be added has a `TrainingName` that already exists. If it does, the command will not succeed
    * Checks that all fields are filled
  * Implemented `EditTraining` command; allows users to edit an existing `TrainingSchedule`
    * If user is editing `TrainingName`, check if the name to edit to already exists. If it does, the command will not succeed
  * Implemented `DeleteTraining` command; allows users to delete an existing `TrainingSchedule`
  * Implemented `FindTraining` command; allows users to filter and display `TrainingSchedules` based on `TrainingName`
  * Handled exceptions for the above commands
  * Set up file read/write operations, training schedule details are stored in `CCATrainings.csv`

* Set up test cases for `Training` related in `TrainingListTest`

  * Set up Table of Contents for User Guide
  * Set up `Training` section of User Guide
  * Set up `Pre-requisites` section of User Guide
  * Set up `FAQ` section of User Guide
