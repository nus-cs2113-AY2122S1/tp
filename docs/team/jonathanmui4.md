## Project: Get Jack'd

Get Jack'd is a Command-Line application that helps busy people manage their workouts and fitness routines quickly by 
typing in commands. It is written in Java and has about 6 kLoC. (6000 lines of code)

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Added storage of data into JSON file in v1.0
    - **What it does**: automatically saves user's workouts in a JSON file whenever the user makes any changes to their
  workout list. (i.e. adding/editing/deleting exercises or workouts)
    - **Justification**: This feature improves the product as the user does not have to remember any of the workouts they 
  have created. In addition, a JSON file does not use text separators to store data which makes the data file more 
  readable and less prone to bugs. 
    - **Difficulties faced**: This implementation was challenging as I had to learn how to use a third party library and
  implement it. 
    - Credits: [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) library was used for this feature. In addition, I 
  referred to a Youtube [Video Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAuGQNR28pW4dOc5uytMdzcQ4-TCJFUN4) to 
  learn how to use the Jackson library. 

- **Enhancement to existing feature**: Allowed users to set a deadline for their newly created workouts in v2.0.

- **New Feature**: Added automatic sorting of workouts according to their deadlines in v2.0
    - **What it does**: automatically sorts user's workouts whenever the user makes any changes to their
      workout list. (i.e. adding/editing/deleting exercises or workouts). The workouts that are due first will appear
  first in the list. The workouts without a deadline will be at the bottom of the list and arranged based on the order
  they are added.
    - **Justification**: This feature improves the product as users can easily see the fitness goals they set for
  themselves and complete their workouts on time.
    - **Difficulties faced**: It was challenging to find an optimal algorithm to sort the workouts, especially since 
  the workout list array list stores both normal workouts and workouts with deadlines (DeadlineWorkout is a child class
  of Workout and WorkoutList is an arraylist of Workouts).
