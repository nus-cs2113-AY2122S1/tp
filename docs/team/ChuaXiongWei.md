## Project: Gordon

Gordon is a Command Line Interface (CLI)-based recipe manager application. It helps
users to organise a collection of recipes using various attributes. It also stores them 
to a text file for future reference. It is written in Java and has around 4 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to _delete_ recipes by index ([#31](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/issues/31))
  * Justification: Allows the User to delete recipes from their cookbook by index.

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to _list_ all recipes ([#46](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/issues/46))

* **New Feature:** Added UI class ([#120](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/issues/120))

* **New Feature:** Added the _set_ time function ([#75](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/issues/75))
