## Overview

### Enhancement implemented
I implemented the budget part, and also helped with some parts in other sections.

Generally, I implemented the following functions:
1) Add a budget (must be a positive number, if there is already an existing budget, the user will be notified and the new value will be added to the original budget rather than replace it)
2) Delete a budget (will be warned if there is no budget in the record)
3) Update a budget (directly replace the original budget)
4) View the budget 

Apart from these functions, I also helped with the implementation of some doc files like "about us" and helped checked others' codes.

### Contribution to UG
