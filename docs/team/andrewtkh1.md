## Project - Large Order Tracking System(LOTS)
Large Order Tracking System (LOTS) is a Command Line (CLI) program that is written in Java and meant to run on `Java 11`.
This program enables users to keep track of multiple food orders from a pre-set list of food items.

### Summary of Contributions

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=andrewtkh1)

- **New Features**:
   - **Added the feature `Find`.**
        - `What it does`- Allows user to search the current list of orders for a specific name.
        - `Justification` - As program is used to track large number of orders,
        the find feature allows the user to easily find a person in the list quickly.
        - `Highlights` - Decision was made to match the user's search input as a substring of
        name too. This would greatly improve the user's experience, as in the event that
        one of the entries name was too long, the user could just search for a substring of the
        name and it would still return as true.
          
- **Enhancements to existing features**:
    - Implemented the `Parser` Class.
        - Had to implement it in such a way that we could return a single `Command` type object that can
        be used by all the different commands.
        - Processes the user's input to determine what type of command was entered.
        This allowed for a more `OOP` way of handling the other different commands and led to a neater & more readable code.
    - Designed the flow of the main class `Duke` to ensure that the different components of the program work together.
        - Added `Logging` in the main class to log any unhandled exceptions.
        - Also allowed us to easily know what error is and where.
    - Designed `Regular Expression (REGEX)` needed for `Add`,`Find` & `Delete` Command.
        - Using `regex` allowed us to narrow the number of edge cases significantly when taking in user inputs.
        - Just had to focus on what is the format of the command.
        - Allowed for easy catching of incorrect input.    
    - Contributed to the overall program by implementing the `UI` & `Unknown Command` class.
    - Added `JUnit` tests for `Parser` & `Find` class.
    - Designed `IO-Redirection` test based on `Equivalence partitioning`.
    - Fixed multiple `Bugs` found ([#38](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/38), [#52](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/52), [#137](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/137), [#230](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/230))

- **Project Management**:
    - Setup Organization & Team Repository.
    - Setup repo's `branch protection` to prevent unauthorized merging.
    - Setup Repo's overall `Markdown` language to be used.
    - Manage `Issue tracker` to ensure no task is left out & all pending tasks are tracked.
    - Manage Milestones (`v1.0`, `v1.0 wrap-up` ,`v1.5`, `v2.0`, `v2.1`)
    - Managed [Releases](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/releases) (`v1.0`, `v2.0`,`v2.1`)
    - PR reviewed with non-trivial comments. ([#101](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/101) ,[#37](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/37) ,[#34](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/34) ,[#42](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/42))

- **User Guide**
    - Added documentation for find Feature. [#159](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/159)
    - Fixed `Anchor` links for content page. [#213](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/231)
        - Initial Markdown language was `GFM` but this had issues with the `anchor`.
        Ultimately decided to revert to the default Markdown language but had to restructure most of our documentation.

    - Added the implementation of `Parser` along with the diagrams & it's alternate implementation.[#110](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/110)
    - Updated the `Product Scope` which consisted of `Target User profile` & `Value Proposition`. [#136](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113-T13-2/tp/pull/136/files)
