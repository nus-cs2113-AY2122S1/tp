## Project - Large Order Tracking System(LOTS)
Large Order Tracking System (LOTS) is a Command Line (CLI) program that enables users to keep track
of multiple food orders from a pre-set list of food items from different stores. The program helps
users to collate the orders and displays a summary of all the orders along with other information such
as an individual person’s order and the corresponding cost, total cost of all the orders and more. 
As LOTS is a CLI program, this would greatly benefit any user that excels in typing.
