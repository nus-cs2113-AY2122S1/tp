# Ng Andre - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
**ConTech** is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing computing-related contacts.

The project started on 3 September 2021, where our team brainstormed and came up with our target users and app
direction. We proceeded to create user stories related to our desired product and narrowed them down for each
iteration so that we were able to comfortably deliver our features.

### Enhancements Implemented

1. `Edit` feature
   - Command to allow the user to edit a contact's details
   - Implementation allows flexible user input with minimal restrictions
2. `Search` feature
   - Command to allow the user to search for a contact
   - Implementation allows flexible user input with optional flags for searching
3. Flags for `delete` feature
   - Update command to allow users to specify a field to be deleted for a contact
   - Implementation allows optional user input for flags to specify deleted fields
4. Parsers
   - `EditContactParser.java`: Parses user input, specified index and specified flags, and creates a syntactically valid `EditContactCommand` to be executed
   - `SearchContactParser.java`: Parses user input for search query and optional flag, and creates a syntactically valid `SearchContactCommand` to be executed
   - `IndexParser.java`: Parses the index specified by the user input for all commands and returns the corresponding `int` value
