## Overview

MedBot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for head nurses to manage patientsâ€™ personal and medical
information. By utilising text-based commands instead of traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI)
based navigation, MedBot can allow head nurses to get their management tasks done quicker and more efficiently.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    * Implement two different role for person: patients and staffs.
        * What it does: Allows a person's record to be added as a patient or as a staff.
