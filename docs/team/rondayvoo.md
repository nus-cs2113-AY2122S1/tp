## Project: Gordon

Gordon is a Command Line Interface (CLI)-based recipe manager application. It helps
users to organise a collection of recipes using various attributes. It also stores them 
to a text file for future reference. It is written in Java and has around 4 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **New Feature:** Added exceptions to prevent the app from crashing frequently ([#29](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/29), [#45](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/45))
  * Justification: Improves defensiveness of code.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to set calories of an existing recipe ([#92](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/92))
  * Justification: Allows user to further customise recipes.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to set difficulty of an existing recipe ([#97](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/97))
  * Justification: Allows user to further customise recipes.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to set price of an existing recipe ([#102](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/102))

* **New Feature:** Added ability to set ingredients of an existing recipe ([#180](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/180))
  * Justification: Users can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to set steps of an existing recipe ([#180](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/180))
  * Justification: Users can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

  * Justification: Allows user to find desired recipes easily.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to find recipes by calories ([#99](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/99))
  * Justification: Allows user to find desired recipes easily.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to find recipes by difficulty ([#99](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/99))
  * Justification: Allows user to find desired recipes easily.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to find recipes by price ([#107](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/107))
  * Justification: Allows user to find desired recipes easily.
* **New Feature:** Added ability to save and load recipes through a text file ([#70](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/70), [#121](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-2/tp/pull/121))
