## Project: Restaurant Buddy

### Overview
Restaurant Buddy is a desktop application designed for restaurant managers to help **keep track of restaurant data**
such as its employees, dishes in the menu and ingredients in storage via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
In particular, Restaurant Buddy was developed specifically for users who can type fast and prefer typing to other
means of input.
