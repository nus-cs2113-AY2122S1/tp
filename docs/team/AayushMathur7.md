### Project: SITUS (Smart Inventory Tracking and Updating System)

The Smart Inventory Tracking and Updating System (SITUS) is a desktop app 
for tracking ingredient inventory designed for restaurant/ F&B inventory 
managers. Users interact with in through a CLI, and is written in Java.

###Given below are my contributions

* **Code Contributed:** You can view the contributed code [here](https://nus-cs2113-ay2122s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2021-09-25&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=AayushMathur7&tabRepo=AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
* **Enhancements Implemented:** 
  1. **`Update` Feature**
     1. **What it does:** This feature is responsible for updating existing ingredients in the database based on 
     the ingredient group number and ingredient number.
     2. **Rationale:** Inventory Managers might need to make adjustments to their inventory from time to time
     in the event that the stock amounts are incorrectly added or subtracted from the ingredient list.
  2. **`Subtract` Feature**
     1. **What it does:** This feature is responsible for subtracting a given amount from an existing 
     ingredient in the database based on the ingredient group number.
     2. **Rationale:** A specified amount of ingredient is removed from the inventory when it's 
     being used to prepare a dish, or sold.  If the ingredient has multiple entries, the earliest 
     expiring one will be deducted first to ensure efficient inventory management.
