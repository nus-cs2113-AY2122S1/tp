## 1. Overview
Stonks XD is an expense managing software that aims to simplify the process of keeping track of one's finances.
The target users for this app are computing students that travels frequently and prefer logging their finances.
The app is able to track your daily expenses, set and adjust your spending limits and give advice based on daily expenses.
It is also able to give visual representations of financial data through bar graphs with currency conversion capabilities.

### 2. Summary of Contributions
* `Ui class`
  * What it does: Handles all the feedback messages and listing message of the program.
  * Justifications: Users requires some sort of feedback to know what they are doing in the program, things include error messages, alerting of missing parameters, indexing and organising of different messages.
  * Highlights: This enhancement requires proper understanding of what needs to be shown, the indexing, different enums, format specifiers like 2 decimal place for money related entries. 
  
  <br>
  
* `Help command`
  * What it does: Listing all possible commands for the users
  * Justifications: Users need to have something to remind them of what commands exist
  * Highlights: Uses  the List library to add every help command and its format into an array, command and its format are all represented as CONSTANTS for easy reconfiguration.

  <br>

* `List commands` 
  * What it does: List out the expenses entries, income entries or entries that the user searched for using find command
  * Justifications: Users that use the Stonks XD program might want to view all the things that they added, so having the capability to list would be a very helpful addition to the program.
  * Highlights: Requires handling of multiple ArrayList of FinancialTracker.

  <br>
  
* `Find command`
  * What it does: Allow users to search through dates, keywords, value and category
  * Justifications: There may be too many entries and having a find function that can filter through all these entries would be very helpful.
Users might want to search not only based on description but also based on dates, values and categories.
  * Highlights: Requires parsing of values from double to string, dates to string and use of try- catch to handle any exceptions thrown. Enums were used in finding categories in place of original version of String.

  <br>
  
* `Balance command` 
  * What it does: Allow users to see the net balance of all expenses and incomes in the program
  * Justifications: Users might want to know how much they have right now so they can decide how much to spend in the future
  * Highlights: Balance is dynamic and it depends on the entries given in the program, so using clear_all_entries would wipe all balance too.

  <br>
  
* `StonksGraph Class` 
  * What it does: Graphing of the various financial calculations into a snapshot with bargraphs
  * Justifications: Users might need some sort of visualisation of their financial data, as numbers by itself are not that helpful. With this feature they will be able to view their monthly expenses throughout the year with ease and identify point of major spending or earning.
  * Highlights: Uses 2D array to represent the graph and uses date library to constantly plot the graph based on current year and current month.

* Evidence of technical accomplishments 
  * Graphing is a component that is quite tricky as it involves 2d arrays, plotting, incorporating different methods to generate each part of the graph. Scaling of graph is another major component that is quite difficult to accomplish.
