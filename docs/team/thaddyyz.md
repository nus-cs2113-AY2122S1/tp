## Project Overview

Large Order Tracking System (LOTS) is a Command Line (CLI) program that enables users to keep track of multiple food orders from a pre-set list of food items from different stores. The program helps users to collate the orders and displays a summary of all the orders along with other information such as an individual personâ€™s order and the corresponding cost, total cost of all the orders and more. As LOTS is a CLI program, this would greatly benefit any user that excels in typing.
