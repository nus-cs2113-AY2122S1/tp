## Project: Budget Tracker
Budget Tracker is a desktop app for managing expenses, budget and loans, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) for tech-savvy students who have trouble keeping track of their expenses.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a list command for budget, expenditure and loan (Pull requests [#33](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/33), [#46](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/46), [#108](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/108)).
  * What it does: allows the user to list their previously added budget, expenditure and loan records.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can see the records added and thus edit them if needed.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It requires an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too is challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.0` - `v2.1` (3 releases) on GitHub


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Edited the list command to warn the users if they overspend for the month (Pull requests [#86](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/86)).
  * Edited the list command to allow the users to list their expenditures according to type (Pull requests [#143](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/143)).
  * Edited the help command to give the explanation of the list command (Pull requests [#208](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/208)).
  * Fixed bugs for list command (Pull request [#149](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/149), [#155](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/155)).

* **Team-based tasks** :
  * Actively participated in weekly project meeting.
  * Set up issue tracker with detailed descriptions and attached labels from time to time (Examples: Issues [#11](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/issues/11)).


* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for feature `list` (Pull request [#143](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/143)).
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation details of the `list` feature (Pull request [#108](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/108)).
    * Added design details of the `Appendix` part. (Pull request [#208](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F11-2/tp/pull/208)).
