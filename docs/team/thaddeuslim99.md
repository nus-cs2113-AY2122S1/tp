### Project: CardLI

CardLI is a desktop app that helps you create, organise, and review flashcards via a Command Line
Interface. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit card content and deck name.
    * What it does: Allows the user to change the front and back of a card, as well as the name of decks.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands 
  and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to move a card from one deck to another.
  * What it does: Allows the user to transfer a card from one deck to another.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in placing a card in
    a certain deck and may wish to move it to another deck in a convenient way rather than having to delete the card and
  add the card in another deck.
  * Comments: This feature was slightly harder to implement compared to the `edit` feature as it needed access to 
  both the system level and the deck level, whereas `edit` either used the system level or the deck level but not both
  at the same time

* **New Feature**: FlashCard Testing.
  * What it does: Through creating the initial Answer, AnswerList and TestManager classes, users can test his/her
  knowledge with the flashcards.
  * Justification: This feature is essential to the product as the purpose of flashcards is to test oneself with them.

* **New Feature**: Capability to skip questions during tests.
  * What it does: Added the ability to skip a question during tests.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user may not know the answer to a flashcard
  and may want to come back to the question later.
  * Comments: This feature was more of a challenge than initially thought. There were many bugs to take care of and the
  underlying method of testing had to be changed to enable this feature. Instead of a for loop testing all the 
  flashcards in a deck, the use of a counter variable to keep track of the current question being tested and a flag
  to check if a question has already been answered had to be developed.

* **New Feature**: Added help command.
  * What it does: Added the ability to ask for the list of commands.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as a user may not want to refer to the user guide
  for instructions.
