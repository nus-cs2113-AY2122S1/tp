Teaching Assistant's Assistant (TAA) is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for keeping track of classes and students.
It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    * **What it does**: Added the `Attendance` class to represent an assessment for a class.
    * **Justification**: Enable the creation of `Assessment` objects with relevant attributes.

* **New Feature**: Added `AssessmentList` class.
    * **What it does**: Added the `AssessmentList` class to represent all the assessments for a class.
    * **Justification**: Enable the creation of the `ArrayList` of `Assessment` objects and the relevant methods.

* **New Feature**: Added `command` classes for `Assessment` across `v1.0` - `v2.1`
    * These include: `AddAssessmentCommand`, `EditAssessmentCommand`, `DeleteAssessmentCommand`, `ListAssessmentsCommand`.
    * **What it does**: Enable user to add, edit, delete and view assessment information to the `AssessmentList`.

      track of them.
