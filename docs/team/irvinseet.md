## Overview

**Mint** is an all-in-one money managing app that helps you track your daily expense and set budgets. It is optimized
for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Summary of Contributions

- **New Feature**: Implemented budget setting
    - What it does: `Budget`: base class which allows user to set spending limit and fetch spending related to
      respective budgets. `BudgetManager` which handles all `Budget`-related actions such as fetching monthly spending
      and limit.

- **New Feature**: Implemented categories' enumeration: `ExpenseCategory` and `IncomeCategory`
    - What it does: Assigned category to entries.
    - Justification: Allow user to easily assign categories to their entry for housekeeping purposes.

- **New Feature**: Implemented skeleton and formatting of help message in Ui
    - What it does: Prints a summary of all commands available.
    - Justification: Help users old and new navigate the app efficiently.

- **Enhancement**: Handled unsafe user input
    - What it does: 2 layered defense system. First, check for any invalid characters. Then, check if valid characters
      are used in correct manner.
    - Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as there are customized messages to tell the user
      which part of their input went wrong.
    - Highlights: It was not easy to find the correct regex pattern to match as they are many factors to consider, such
      as optional tags.

- **Enhancement**: Allow users to key in entries without specify `date` or `category`
    - What it does: initialisation of fields when user do not specify some fields. e.g, `date` initialised
      to `LocalDate.now()` and `category` initialised to `OTHERS`
    - Justification: It may be tedious for user to type out the entirety of the entry. Users using expense tracking app
      mostly key in their expenses on the same day. Also, they may want to key in quickly and then edit the relevant
      fields in their own time.

- **Enhancement**: Allow users to key in entries
  in [10 different date formats](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#acceptable-date-formats)
    - What it does: User can type in date in any of the 10 given formats and our program can identify it correctly.
    - Justification: Different users have different preference in terms of keying in date.

- **Enhancement**: Implemented a parsing fuction that reads input correctly despite jumbled up tags
    - What it does: `parseInputByTags` method, a one-size-fits-all which parse user inputs by tags regardless of order
      using regex. As tags are essential to our app, it is for many functions.
    - Justification: Users do not have to worry about following a "strict" format. Improves user experience
