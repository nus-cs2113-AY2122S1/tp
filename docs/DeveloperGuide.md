## üìî Design

This section brings developers through the general flow of the programme, and the various components involved.

### Main Components

This section describes the overall design architecture of *Food-O-Rama*.

The `Main` class is responsible for initializing the main components upon start-up of the application, and deciding the
execution path of the application through the main components based on reading the user inputs.

The application consists of the following main components responsible for the high-level execution of a user input:

1. `Foodorama`: Initializes all the other components and coordinates them.
2. `Ui`: Handles the displaying of all command results and error messages to the user.
3. `Storage`: Handles the creation, reading from and writing from the `/data` directory
4. `InputParser`: Makes sense of the user input and decides which `Command` class to call.
5. `DishList`: Handles the collection of Dish objects *Food-O-Rama* uses.
6. `IngredientList`: Handles the collection of Ingredient objects *Food-O-Rama* uses.
7. `Command`: The collection of classes that handle the different user commands.

The architecture diagram below shows a high-level overview of the structure between different components.

<br>

### General Flow

Description of the step-by-step sequence from User Input to the Output.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/main_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 2: General Flow Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>


1. User is greeted by welcome screen.
2. User begins typing inputs.
3. Inputs get parsed by InputParser returning the appropriate type of command and respective parameters.
4. Command gets executed and respective output gets displayed.
5. Once user is done using the application, they can send an exit message prompting a goodbye message.
6. Application exits.

### Input Parsing

The `InputParser` class is responsible for deconstructing User Inputs to identify Commands and Parameters for execution.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/input_parser_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 3: InputParser Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

1. Gets command name of user input by checking if the users input starts with any of the strings that are defined for
  commands (add dish, list dish, help etc.).
2. Throws an exception if no matching command is found.
3. Takes rest of user input as parameterString.
4. Based on command name, splits the parameterString into respective parameters to respective command classes for
  execution.

### Storage

The `Storage` class is responsible for the reading and writing of *Food-O-Rama* data. Data is stored as .txt files
under *'Data'* folder.

* After every operation, writes the names of the Ingredient, weight of Ingredient Stored and weight of Ingredient Wasted,
  into a text file called `ingredients.txt`.
* After every operation, writes the names of the Dish, weight of Dish Waste and constituents of the Dish if there are
  any, into a text file called `dishes.txt`.

#### Loading Data

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/storage_load_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 4: Loading Data Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

1. At the start of the program, Foodorama calls `Storage.load()`.
    * This method in the `Storage` class is responsible for invoking `loadIngredients()`, `loadDishes()`
      and `loadFormat()`.
2. After accessing `ingredients.txt`, `ingredientList.add()` is called for every ingredient that exists in the list and
  is added to the active ArrayList, `IngredientList.ingredientList`.
3. Then, after accessing `dishes.txt`, `dishList.add()` is called for every dish that exists in the list and is added to
  the active ArrayList, `DishList.dishList`.
4. Any inputs in the data file that are invalid get disregarded and only valid inputs get loaded. As a result the invalid
  inputs get sanitized once *Food-O-Rama* is started.
5. Finally, the method also sets up the `formats.txt` file that contains all the relevant formats in which the data is
  saved along with examples.
    * This is present in the load method as opposed to the write method as it only needs to be called once per run of 
      *Food-O-Rama*.

üí° *Note: `dishes.txt`,`ingredients.txt` and `formats.txt` can be found in the `data` folder from the root directory.*

#### Saving Data

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/storage_write_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 5: Saving Data Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

* After every command, Foodorama calls `Storage.write(Ingredient)`, then `Storage.write(Dish)`.
    * This method in the `Storage` class is responsible for writing to the respective text file depending on the mode.
* `Storage.write()` will access the respective text file and save to its respective save format.

* üí° **Save Formats:**
    * Dishes
        * `DISH_NAME | DISH_WASTAGE | DISH_WASTAGE / NUM_OF_LINKED_INGREDIENTS | LIMIT | INGREDIENTS_LINKED`
        * Limit is `-1` if limit has not been defined.
        * `DISH_WASTAGE/NUM_OF_LINKED_INGREDIENTS` is `DISH_WASTAGE` if no ingredients have been linked.
    * Ingredients
        * `INGREDIENT_NAME | INGREDIENT_STORAGE | INGREDIENT_WASTAGE | LIMIT | EXPIRY`
        * Limit is `-1` if limit has not been defined.
        * Expiry is `null` if expiry has not been defined.

### Data Structures

The `Dish`, `DishList`, `Ingredient` and `IngredientList` classes are responsible for the handling and manipulation of
the *Food-O-Rama* data.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/data_structures.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 6: Data Structures Class Diagram</center>
<br>

* The `Dish` class contains the Dish's Name, its wastage and its constituents.
* The `Ingredient` class contains the Ingredient's Name, the weight of Ingredient in storage, the weight of Ingredient
  wasted as well as the weight of Ingredient wasted from Dish wastage.
* The `DishList` class comprises an array of `Dish` along with functions to find, retrieve and modify dishes.
* The `IngredientList` class comprises an array of `Ingredient` along with functions to find, retrieve and modify
  ingredients.
    * The Sort function arranges Dishes / Ingredients in descending order of their wastage weight.
    * The Graph function visualises the wastage of Dishes / Ingredients for easier analysis.

### User-Interface Component

The `Ui` Class is responsible for the printing of interactive messages whenever a user types an input. It handles print
messages to the Command Line Interface from when the program loads, to after every input by the user, and finally when
the user exits the program.

The class diagram below shows the structure and relations of the `Ui` class in *Food-O-Rama*.


<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/UiClass.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 7: User Interface Class Diagram</center>
<br>

For simplicity‚Äôs sake the Ui class has been minimized into 3 components:

* The strings containing the various messages.
* Functions that get a string from Ui to be used elsewhere (e.g. Exception classes getting error messages).
* Functions that print command outputs.

### Exceptions

The `FoodoramaException` class is responsible for handling errors such as unrecognised user commands and improper
parameters. 

It does so by calling the `Ui` class to provide the error messages and throwing the exception up to the
highest level, the `Foodorama` class, where it then gets caught and the message is printed with the
`exception.getMessage()` method which is part of the base Exception class.

### Command Abstraction

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/command.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 8: Command Abstraction Diagram</center>
<br>

* Different Command Classes that perform different tasks by calling various functions of the Object Classes.
* All inherit from an abstract `Command` class with one execute method that takes an Arraylist<String> as input.
* These command classes help perform a more specialized input validation so ensure the inputs match the specific command
  that has been invoked.

### Input Validation

In addition to the input parser, due to the different types of inputs *Food-O-Rama* deals with, there exists a second round
of input validation to help seperate the invalid inputs from those that are valid.

Below is the sequence diagram for the validation of Numerical Inputs.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/input_validation_number.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 9: Input Validation for Number Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

The system filters out the numerical inputs from the text strings, and checks if the numerical inputs are
integers or not providing the actual methods that execute the computation (the only valid inputs are integers in this
case). The same process can be done to include doubles as well by excluding the final integer check.

The sequence diagram for the validation of Strings is given below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/input_validation_string.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 10: Input Validation for String Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

The process of input validation for strings is similar to that for integers except only words are valid inputs.

## ‚úç Implementation
This section explores the overall implementation of the different main functions and how they work.

### Add

The add command allows for the addition of dishes and ingredients, and wastage weights and storage weights.

#### Adding Dishes and Ingredients

The `add dish` and `add ingr` commands are handled by the `AddDishCommand` and `AddIngrCommand` classes respectively.
Both commands have a similar implementation, with the difference being that `add ingr` has an additional weight input as
further described in the sequence diagram below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/add_ingr_command_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 11: AddIngredientCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

For `add dish` and `add ingr` commands:

1. `AddDishCommand` or `AddIngredientCommand` will proceed with basic Input Validation, and
   call `TYPEList.add[DISH/INGR_NAME]`, where `TYPE` is either `Dish` or `Ingredient` respectively.

        For Adding Dishes, skip to Step 6.

2. For Adding Ingredients, `IngredientList.add()` will prompt storage weight input of the Ingredient from the user and
   throw exceptions if the storage weight is not an integer, is `Infinity` is `NaN`, or is negative.

3. If storage weight input is greater than 10000 kg (*soft limit*), the user will be prompted with a confirmation
   message.

4. If the user enters `n` or `no`, the input weight prompt will loop until the user inputs a valid number.

5. Else, the ingredient is added to the ingredient list.

6. Dishes will be added to the dish list without the prompt for storage weight input.

7. The Ui class is then called to print a success message to the user.

#### Adding Wastage to Dishes and Ingredients, Storage to Ingredients

The `add dish waste`, `add ingr waste` and `add ingr storage` commands are handled by the `AddDishWasteCommand`
, `AddIngrWasteCommand` and `AddIngrStoredCommand` classes respectively. All three commands have similar implementation
as described by the sequence diagram below for Adding Wastage to Dishes.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/add_dish_waste_command_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 12: AddDishWasteCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

For `add dish waste`, `add ingr waste` and `add ingr stored` commands:

1. The input will be handled by their respective command classes with Basic Input Validation and call the `Dish`
   or `List`
   class methods `addWeight` (for waste) or `updateIngredientStoredWeight` (for ingredient stored.)

2. The methods will prompt weight input from the user and throw exceptions if the weight is not an integer,
   is `Infinity`, is `NaN` or is negative.

3. If weight input is greater than 10000 kg (*soft limit*), the user will be prompted with a confirmation message.

4. If the user enters `n` or `no`, the input weight prompt will loop until the user inputs a valid number.

5. Else, the weight input is added to the dish/ingredient wastage or ingredient storage.

6. The Ui class is then called to print a success message to the user.

The difference between the three commands lies in the `add dish waste` command, where the wastage must be added to the
ingredients linked to it as seen in the Code Snippet below.

Code Snippet:

```
    if (!parts.isEmpty()) {
        ingredientContribution = wastage / parts.size();
        for (Ingredient ingredient : parts) {
            // Change in contribution is change in wastage / num of parts
            ingredient.addDishWaste(inputWastage / parts.size());
        }
    }
```

### Find

The find commands (`find dish` and `find ingr`) implement the `FindCommand` class to allow the user to search for a
particular `KEYWORD` and return a list of Dishes or Ingredients that match the keyword.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/find_command_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 13: FindCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

For `find` commands, the handling method `FindCommand.execute()`:

1. Parses the input and determines if a dish or ingredient is to be found, and uses corresponding switch cases. If it is
   neither, throw an Invalid Parameter error via FoodoramaException.

2. If the keyword to be found is blank, throw a Missing Parameter error via FoodoramaException.

3. Else, checks if the input keyword exists in the name of every Dish or Ingredient in their respective list classes.

4. Stores all Dishes or Ingredients with a matching name in a new ArrayList.

5. Calls the Ui class to print the new ArrayList to the user.

### Edit

The implementation of the Edit function allows the User to edit several instance variables of the Dishes and Ingredients
present in the DishList and IngredientList.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/edit_dish_name_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 14: EditDishNameCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

This Sequence Diagram shows how the `EditDishNameCommand` class functions.

Currently, the User is able to edit the following:

* Dish Name
* Dish Wastage Weight
* Ingr Name
* Ingr Wastage Weight
* Ingr Storage Weight

The remaining Edit classes, namely `EditDishWasteCommand`, `EditIngrNameCommand`,
`EditIngrStoredCommand` and `EditIngrWasteCommand` follow sequences similar to the one shown above in their
implementation.

### Set

The implementation of the set function allows the User to set the expiry date for ingredients

Below is a sequence diagram that shows how the SetExpiryCommand functions

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/set_expiry.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 15: EditDishNameCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

1. The input will be handled by the basic input validation within the command class to figure out which ingredient is to be changed

2. The methods will prompt a date input as a sting and will throw exceptions if date is of an invalid format.

3. If the input is a valid date, the function will calculate the days till expiry. If this result turns out to be negative (in the past), the user is prompted to re-enter a date

4. There is currently a soft limit of 10000 days for the expiry. If this limit is exceeded the user will be prompted for confirmation before proceeding as 10000 is an unusual amount for the field and might be a misinput.

5. If the user enters `n` or `no`, the user is prompted to re-enter a date.

6. Else, the previously entered date is set as the expiry.

7. The Ui class is then called to print a success message to the user.

### Link

The Link function allows Users to link existing Ingredients in the IngredientList to the existing Dishes in the DishList
that use them. The diagram below showcases the sequence of the `LinkCommand` class.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/link_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 16: LinkCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

1. The LinkCommand calls upon DishList to get the Dish based on the Index given via UserInput.
2. DishList then calls on Dish to carry out the addPart(ingredientName) function which is responsible for the linking of
  the Dish and Ingredient.
3. Dish calls on IngredientList through the find function, to which IngredientList returns the Index of the Ingredient.
4. Given the index is non-negative, the addPart function then removes any old contributions of Ingredient Wastes in the
  current Dish's Waste through a loop.
5. Subsequently, it adds the Ingredient to the Dish's parts following which it updates the Dish's own Ingredient
  Contribution.
6. Finally, the function re-updates the contribution of all linked Ingredient's Wastes to the Dish's Waste.

### Graph

The implementation of the Graph function allows Food-O-Rama to display a graph of the Dishes and Ingredients present in the DishList and IngredientList to the User.

Below is a sequence diagram that shows how the GraphCommand functions.


<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/graph_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 17: GraphCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

Graph works by creating a two-dimensional grid and printing the bars based on the current position of the terminal cursor. 
This bypasses the restriction in a CLI based application where you can only print from top down in the terminal and the bars can get
printed "vertically". This is done by calculating the lengths of the bars beforehand and using these lengths along with
the current coordinates to print either an empty space or a bar.

Despite this, due to CLI and ASCII limitations, printing of fractional values poses an issue. This is because we cannot
print half a character and using special unicode characters would break cross-platform functionality. The
solution that we implemented was to have a digit in the top most bar if we have fractional heights. This way while we
still don't get a perfect representation, we are capable of giving the value accurate to one decimal place. So if the
height was 3.33 units it would be represented by 3 filled bars and the 4th bar will have a 3 within indicating its value
is between 3.3 to 3.4 as shown in the figure below.

```

### Random Dish

The `RandomDishCommand` class is used to generate a random Dish Name.

The random Dish Name is a combination of Strings from 4 different ArrayLists.

These ArrayLists are carbohydrates, proteins, sauces and cookingMethods. The ArrayLists contain a fixed pool of
vocabulary.

Code Snippet:

```
ArrayList<String> carbohydrates = new ArrayList<>() {
        {
            add("rice");
            add("noodles");
            add("beans");
            add("potatoes");
            add("pizza");
            add("burger");
            add("pasta");
        }
    };

    ArrayList<String> proteins = new ArrayList<>() {
        {
            add("chicken");
            add("turkey");
            add("beef");
            add("pork");
            add("duck");
            add("lamb");
            add("fish");
            add("lobster");
        }
    };

    ArrayList<String> sauces = new ArrayList<>() {
        {
            add("chili");
            add("tomato");
            add("mustard");
            add("cheesy");
            add("soy sauce");
            add("mayonnaise");
            add("sweet");
        }
    };

    ArrayList<String> cookingMethods = new ArrayList<>() {
        {
            add("steamed");
            add("grilled");
            add("fried");
            add("baked");
            add("smoked");
            add("roasted");
        }
    };
```

Random Dish Name is then generated by taking a random String element from each of these 4 ArrayLists and adding a white
space between the Strings. The generated Dish Name is stored in the String variable `generatedDishName` to be printed to
the user.

Code Snippet:

```
        Ui UI = new Ui();

        Random randomMethod = new Random();

        int carbohydratesIndex = randomMethod.nextInt(carbohydrates.size());
        int proteinsIndex = randomMethod.nextInt(proteins.size());
        int saucesIndex = randomMethod.nextInt(sauces.size());
        int cookingMethodsIndex = randomMethod.nextInt(cookingMethods.size());

        String generatedDishName = cookingMethods.get(cookingMethodsIndex) + " "
                + sauces.get(saucesIndex) + " "
                + proteins.get(proteinsIndex) + " "
                + carbohydrates.get(carbohydratesIndex) + " ";

        this.randomDishName = generatedDishName;

        UI.printRandomDishName(generatedDishName);
```

This allows the user to generate new Dish ideas.

### Sort

The `SortDishCommand` and `SortIngrCommand` classes are used to sort the Dishes and Ingredients respectively, according
to their Wastages in descending order. This allows the user to view the most wasted Dishes and Ingredients at the top.

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/sort_dish_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 18: SortDishCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

<p align="center">
    <img src="https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w11-4.github.io/tp/images/sort_ingr_sequence.png">
</p>
<center>Figure 19: SortIngrCommand Sequence Diagram</center>
<br>

* The Sort functions work by calling on the pre-existing Comparator function in ArrayList. Using this, they sort the
  Dishes and Ingredients in descending order of their wastage.
* Once done, the Sort Commands call on the list() function present in both DishList and IngredientList.
* The list() function calls upon the `Ui` class to print the list of Dishes or Ingredients via the printDishList(
  dishList) or printIngrList(ingredientList) functions.

### Terminal Refreshing / Clear Screen

The interface of the program utilizes the ClearScreen class to clear the terminal after every user input through the
built-in `ProcessBuilder` Java class. Such a feature allows greater readability and focus for the user as the terminal
will not be cluttered with past commands.
`Ui` will call `ClearScreen.clearConsole()` method to clear the terminal.

The ProcessBuilder class will send a respective command to the terminal depending on the Operating System of the user.
The command it sends to the terminal is as follows:

* `cls` for Windows CMD Terminals.
* `clear` for Linux/MacOS Terminals.

`ClearConsole()` Code Snippet:

```

## üìÇ Product Scope

Provides Developers with insights into our intended customers and the background to the problem to which
*Food-O-Rama* finds a solution.

### Target User Profile

Restaurant owners who will delegate their Inventory Management to Managers who are fast typists with experience in using
the Command Line Interface.

### Value Proposition

By presenting the wastage statistics, we can help restaurant owners figure out which dishes are contributing the most to
wastage at the restaurant. This way, they can allocate their resources more efficiently to better doing dishes. Thus, we
are reducing time wastage due to cooking of excess dishes and also saving money from purchasing unnecessary ingredients.
Therefore, there‚Äôs a two-fold saving. Additionally, we are also contributing to reducing Singapore's contribution to    
global food wastage.

## üß™ Instructions for Manual Testing

* For Manual Testing, you can write sample data into data text files (`dishes.txt` & `ingredients.txt`).

Dish
Format: `[DISH_NAME] | [AMOUNT_WASTED_IN_KG] | [WASTAGE_DIVIDED_BY_NUM_OF_LINKED_INGR] | [WASTAGE_LIMIT] | [INGR_1|INGR_2|etc.]`

* üí° *Note*: `[WASTAGE_LIMIT]` is `-1` when no limit is set.

Dish example of usage:

```
No Linked Ingredients, No Limit, Wastage of 2kg:
chicken rice|2.0|2.0|-1

2 Linked Ingredients (chicken and rice), Wastage of 2kg, No Limit:
chicken rice|2.0|1.0|-1|chicken|rice

2 Linked Ingredients (chicken and rice), Wastage of 2kg, Limit of 3kg:
chicken rice|2.0|1.0|3|chicken|rice
```

Ingredient Format: `[INGR_NAME] | [AMOUNT_STORED_IN_KG] | [AMOUNT_WASTED_IN_KG] | [WASTAGE_LIMIT] | [EXPIRY_DATE]`

* üí° *Note*:

    * `[WASTAGE_LIMIT]` is `-1` when no limit is set.
    * `[EXPIRY_DATE]` follows the format `dd/MM/yyyy`.
    * `[EXPIRY_DATE]` is `null` when no expiry date is set.

Ingredient example of usage:

```
No Limit, No Expiry, Storage of 2kg, Wastage of 1kg:
duck|2.0|1.0|-1|null
