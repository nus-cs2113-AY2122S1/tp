## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the Smart Inventory
Tracking and Updating System (SITUS).

### 1.2. Audience
The intended audience for this document are developers looking to introduce new functionalities based on their needs.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2. First-time setup
### 2.1. Prerequisites
1. **Java JDK 11** installed on computer
2. **IntelliJ IDEA** most recent version

### 2.2. Setting up the project on the computer
1. Clone **[this](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-3/tp.git)** repo onto your computer.
2. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in welcome screen, click **`File`** > **`Close Project`** to close the existing project first).
3. Set up the correct JDK 11 for IntelliJ.
   1. Click **`File`** > **`Project Structure..`** > **`Project`**.
   2. Click the arrow drop-down button in **`Project SDK`**.
   3. Choose **`11 Amazon Correcto version 11.0.12`**.
   4. In the same dialog, set the Project language level field to the SDK default option.
   5. Click **`Apply`** and **`OK`**.
4. Click **`File`** > **`Open`** 
5. Locate and select the cloned project directory.
6. Accept all defaults as prompted by IntelliJ.

### 2.3. Running the program for the first time
1. Run the main SITUS program in `src/main/java/seedu.situs/Situs`.
2. Key in a few commands to make sure the program works.
>:exclamation: **Note**: Before proceeding with step 3, make sure all the contents in the file `data/ingredients.txt`
> are fully deleted. The Junit tests in step 3 will not pass if there are contents already in the storage file.
3. Run the Junit tests in `/src/test/java/seedu.situs` to make sure the programs passes all tests.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3. Design

### 3.1. System Architecture

![System Architecture](images/SysArch%20Diagram.png)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above explains the high-level design of the application.


The App consists of 6 major components:
* `Main`: Initializes and connects the components together
* `UI`: Class that deals with the interaction with the user.
* `Parser`: Class that processes inputs and executes commands.
* `Command`: A set of classes covering the functionalities of the App.
* `IngredientGroup`: Class that holds all entries of a single ingredient.
* `IngredientList`: Class that holds the list of all ingredients in the inventory. It is made up of multiple instances of `IngredientGroup`.
* `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Interaction between architecture components**

The _sequence diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for a generic command input. 
> Note: `XYZCommand` is henceforth used as a placeholder for the different command names, e.g. `AddCommand`

![image](images/InteractionSeqDiagram.png)

Each of the 6 components (apart from `main`) can be found in their respective packages.

### 3.2. UI component

The **UI** component can be found in the `UI` package. The UI reads commands from the user, sends the command to `Main` to be executed and prints an output message upon completion of the command or if an error occurred.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3. Parser component

The **Parser** component can be found in the `parser` package. 

The package consists of the `Parser` class, which parses the command input by the user and executes the required `XYZCommand` class.



### 3.4. Command component

The **Command** component can be found in the `command` package

The package consists of an abstract class `Command` and classes named `XYZCommand`. `Command` has only one abstract method, `run()`. All `XYZCommand` classes inherit from `Command` and implement `run()` to execute the corresponding commands. 

The class diagram below shows the relationships between `Parser`, `Command` and `XYZCommand`.

![image](images/ParserDiagram.png)

A quick overview of how a command is parsed and executed is as such:
* The command entered by the user is passed to `Parser`.
* `Parser` calls its `parseXYZCommand()` method with the command entered by the user as its parameter.
* `parseXYZCommand()` creates an instance of the corresponding `XYZCommand` class and calls its `run()` method.
* Thus, the command entered by the user is executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5. IngredientGroup component
The **IngredientGroup** component can be found in the `ingredients` package

An instance `IngredientGroup` is created for each new ingredient.
A new ingredient is defined as one with a different name as compared to all existing ingredients.

Each instance of `IngredientGroup` is made up multiple `Ingredient`. One entry in an `IngredientGroup` corresponds to one `Ingredient`.
All entries with the same ingredient name is stored in the same `IngredientGroup`.

In the example below, there are 2 `IngredientGroup`, Carrot and White Carrot. Carrot contains 2 `Ingredient` (entries) while White Carrot contains 3 `Ingredient` (entries).
```
1. Carrot | Total Amount: 12.2 kg
    1.1. Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 23/12/2021 
    1.2. Amount Left: 2.2 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
	
2. White Carrot | Total Amount: 17.1 kg
    2.1. Amount Left: 5.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
    2.2. Amount Left: 2.1 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
    2.3. Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 01/02/2022
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.6. IngredientList component

The **IngredientList** component can be found in the `ingredients` package

Below is a partial class diagram of the `IngredientList` component

![image](images/IngredientListDiagram.png)

The `IngredientList` class 
* receives stored data(if any) from `Storage` when the first command is executed
* stores each group of `Ingredient` objects in `IngredientGroup`, grouped by their `name`
* sends the stored data to the `Storage` class for storage after command execution 

Each of the `Ingredient` objects contains information about an ingredient, namely its `name`, `amount` in stock and the `expiry` date.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.7. Storage component

The **Storage** component can be found in the `Storage` package

Below is a partial class diagram of the `Storage` component

![image](images/StorageDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class
* loads/makes storage data file in memory when its constructor is called.
* has a public method to return the `ArrayList` of `Ingredient` type in the storage file.
* has a public method can take an `ArrayList` of `Ingredient` to write to the memory file.

The two public methods mentioned above are the most essential for the storage capability of the program.
`IngredientList` object will only use `loadIngredientsFromMemory()` and `writeIngredientsToMemory()` methods
of the storage class only when there is a change in the ingredient list of the program.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. Implementation
This sections provides details regarding the implementation of the more significant features of SITUS.

### 4.1. Adding Ingredients
Ingredients can be added using the `add` command followed by 3 parameters prefixed with flags for identification by SITUS:
* `n/`: Name of the ingredient
* `a/` : Amount of the ingredient (kg)
* `e/` : Expiry date of the ingredient (DD/MM/YYYY)

E.g. `add n/carrots a/200 e/25-12-2021`

1. The initial user input is stored as an entire string. It is first processed by the `Parser` class. `Parser` first checks for the validity of the input. 
   If valid, it then breaks the user input into an array of 3 elements and converts the parameters into their appropriate variable types. 


2. The array containing the parameters are then passed to the `AddCommand` class which calls the `add` method in `IngredientList`. 


3. First, `isIngredientInList(ingredientName)` method in `IngredientList' checks if the new ingredient to be added is repeated. The ingredient name is used as the key to search.
   * If the ingredient already exists in the ingredient list, the `get(ingredientIndex)` method searches for the index of the corresponding group that the ingredient belongs to, and appends the ingredient details to the end of the current ingredient group.
   * If the ingredient does not exist in the ingredient list, a new `IngredientGroup` is created. 


4. The updated `IngredientList` is stored in the external memory through the `Storage` class. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The overall sequence diagram can be seen below. 

![image](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2. Alerts

Alerts are displayed automatically on startup, and when the user enters the command to display alerts. There are 3 types of commands:
* `alerts all`: displays alerts for both alert types below
* `alerts expiry`: displays alerts for ingredients expiring within a threshold number of days
* `alerts stock`: displays alerts for ingredients with stock lower than a threshold amount

The user is able to call any of the 3 methods on their own, while on startup, the `alerts all` command is automatically called via the `AlertCommand` class.

The sequence diagram for when the user inputs `alerts all` is shown below.

![image](images/AlertsAllSequenceDiagram.png)

All constructors for the command classes are called right before the relevant `run()` methods, as in `new XYZCommand().run()`. These are not shown in the diagram for simplicity. 

The `alerts all` command is passed into the `parser` class's `parse` command, which invokes the `parseAlertsCommand` method.

Next, an `AlertCommand` class is instantiated and `run` is called. This further calls 2 classes and runs them
1. The `AlertExpiringSoonCommand` class: Returns a list of ingredients expiring by a calculated date 
2. The `AlertLowStockCommand` class: Returns a list of ingredients with stock lesser than the threshold 

Each of the classes returns a String after `run`, which the `AlertCommand` class sends back to the parser to be returned.

The sequence diagram for the `AlertExpiringSoonCommand.run()` is shown below. The user can also call this via `alerts expiry`

![image](images/AlertExpirySequenceDiagram.png)

The current date is obtained via the `CurrentDate` class, with which the threshold number of days is added to obtain the threshold date.

The expiry date of `Ingredient` object in each `IngredientGroup` in the `IngredientList` class is taken and compared to the threshold date. 
The information of the `Ingredient` is taken note of to be printed when the function returns.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For `AlertLowStockCommand`, it is less complicated, and the sequence diagram shown below. The user can also call this via `alerts stock`

![image](images/AlertStockSequenceDiagram.png)

The `totalAmount` for each `IngredientGroup` in the `IngredientList` is obtained and compared to the threshold amount. The 
information of the `IngredientGroup` is taken note of to be printed when the function is returned.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.3. Deleting ingredients

Delete is performed on individual ingredients in groups. Users are to supply the information for the ingredient to delete by 
their groups and numbers in the list. For example, the current ingredient inventory is:
```
1. Carrot | Total Amount: 12.200 kg
    1.1. Amount Left: 10.000 kg | Expiry Date: 23/12/2021
    1.2. Amount Left: 2.200 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021

2. Potato | Total Amount: 7.100 kg
    2.1. Amount Left: 2.100 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
    2.2. Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021

3. Beef | Total Amount: 5.100 kg
    3.1. Amount Left: 5.100 kg | Expiry Date: 01/02/2022
```
Then, calling `delete 1.1` will remove the second entry in the `carrot` category.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the above command example.

![image](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.4. Updating ingredients
Ingredients can be updated using `update` command followed by two parameters - first of which is a number
indicating the specific ingredient in an ingredient group, followed a parameter prefixed with flag for identification
by SITUS. 

E.g. `update 1.2 a/150.0`
1. The current ingredient inventory is:

   ```
   1. Carrot | Total Amount: 18.7 kg
       1.1 Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 23/12/2021
       1.2 Amount Left: 2.2 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
       1.3 Amount Left: 6.5 kg | Expiry Date: 02/01/2022
   
   2. Potato | Total Amount: 7.1 kg
       2.1 Amount Left: 5.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
       2.2 Amount Left: 2.1 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
   ```

2. The initial user input is stored as a string. It is pre-processed by the `Parser` class that
checks the validity of the inputs. If inputs are valid, the string is broken into an array 
of 3 elements, and it's parameters are converted into it's appropriate data types.

3. The 3 elements within the array get passed as arguments in the `UpdateCommand` class that calls the `update`
method in the `IngredientList` class.

4. The `update` method calls the `getIngredientGroup` method in the `IngredientList` class
to find the ingredient group to be updated.

5. Then, in the `IngredientGroup` class, the
   `get` method is called on the identified ingredient group to get the ingredient 
   object that is to be updated.

6. The total amount of ingredient within the group is updated to the new amount 
by the `updateTotalAmount` method in the `IngredientGroup` class.

7. Next, The ingredient amount of the ingredient is set using the `setAmount` method.

8. Lastly, the updated `ingredientList` is stored in the external memory through the `Storage`
   class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

After the ingredient has been updated, the ingredient inventory list is:

```
1. Carrot | Total Amount: 166.5 kg
    1.1 Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 23/12/2021
    1.2 Amount Left: 150.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
    1.3 Amount Left: 6.5 kg | Expiry Date: 02/01/2022

2. Potato | Total Amount: 7.1 kg
    2.1 Amount Left: 5.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
    2.2 Amount Left: 2.1 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
```

The sequence diagram below illustrates the above command example.

![image](images/UpdateSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.5. Subtracting ingredients
Ingredient amount can be subtracted using `subtract` command followed by two parameters that
contain a prefixed flag for SITUS to identify the ingredient's name and subtract amount.

E.g. `subtract n/carrot a/150.0`
1. The current ingredient inventory is:

   ```
   1. Carrot | Total Amount: 166.5 kg
       1.1 Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 23/12/2021
       1.2 Amount Left: 150.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
       1.3 Amount Left: 6.5 kg | Expiry Date: 02/01/2022
   
   2. Potato | Total Amount: 7.1 kg
       2.1 Amount Left: 5.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
       2.2 Amount Left: 2.1 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
   ```

2. The initial user input is stored as a string. It is pre-processed by the `Parser` class that
   checks the validity of the inputs. If inputs are valid, the string is broken into an array
   of 2 elements, and it's parameters are converted into it's appropriate data types.

3. The 2 elements within the array get passed as arguments in the `SubtractCommand` class that 
calls the `SubtractIngredientFromGroup` method in the `IngredientList` class.

4. The `SubtractIngredientFromGroup` method calls the `findIngredientIndexInList` method 
in the `IngredientList` class to find the index of the ingredient to subtract amount from.

5. Then, the `getIngredientGroup` method is called to get the ingredient group.

6. If the ingredient has a negligible amount remaining, the group is removed,
the updated ingredientList is stored in the external memory through the `Storage` class, 
and the function is returned.

7. If not, the input subtract amount is subtracted from the ingredient group. The subtraction
iterates from ingredients with closest to the furthest expiry dates. There are two scenarios during iteration:
   1. Remaining amount to be subtracted is less than (or equal) current ingredient amount
      1. The amount to be subtracted is subtracted from the current ingredient amount:
      2. The amount to be subtracted is set to 0.0.
   2. Remaining amount to be subtracted is greater than current ingredient amount:
      1. The current ingredient amount is set to 0.0.
      2. The current ingredient amount is subtracted from the amount to be subtracted.

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

8. Next, the `removeLowAmountIngredientFromGroup` method is called to remove ingredients with 
negligible amounts remaining.

9. Lastly, the updated `ingredientList` is stored in the external memory through the Storage class.

10. After the ingredient amount has been subtracted, the ingredient inventory list is:

```
1. Carrot | Total Amount: 16.5 kg
    Amount Left: 10.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
    Amount Left: 6.5 kg | Expiry Date: 02/01/2022
   
2. Potato | Total Amount: 7.1 kg
    Amount Left: 5.0 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
    Amount Left: 2.1 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
```

The sequence diagram below illustrates the above command example.


![image](images/SubtractSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.6. Searching for Ingredients
Ingredients can be searched for either by name using `find` or by expiry date using `expire`. 

#### 4.6.1. Searching by Name
The command to find ingredients by name uses the keyword `find` followed by the keywords/names to search the ingredient list for.
Some examples are `find carrot`, `find potato tomato`. Here is an overview of what happens when a `find` command is run:

1. The initial user input is stored as a string. The word `find` is removed and the remaining string (consisting only of space-separated keywords) 
is split by spaces and stored as an array of type `String`. 

2. The array of keywords is then iterated through and checked for either empty values (no keyword given) or invalid characters (non-alphanumeric) and an error is thrown if either 
exist. If these checks pass, the current keyword is added to a `HashSet` object and the next keyword is checked. This avoids duplicate keywords being searched for once the entire array of keywords has been iterated through.

3. The `HashSet` of keywords is then iterated through and for each keyword, an instance of the `FindCommand` class is created and its `run()` method is called. This 
searches the names in the ingredient list for the given keyword, and displays an output message showing the results found, if any. 

The partial sequence diagram of the above process is shown below:
![image](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.6.2. Searching by Expiry Date
The command to find ingredients by expiry date uses the keyword `expire` followed by the expiry date to search in the format dd/mm/yyyy. 
The command will display all ingredients in the list that are expiring **by** and **on** the given date. An example of its usage is `expire 23/12/2021`.
Here is an overview of what happens when an `expire` command is run:

1. The command is stored as a string and split by spaces into its 2 parameters, `expire` and the date to search for. The date given is then converted into a `LocalDate`
object using the `stringToDate` method of the `Ingredient` class.

2. This date is passed into the constructor of the `ExpireCommand` class and its `run()` method is called. This method iterates through the current ingredient list
and adds any ingredient whose expiry date and the given date differ by less than 0 days (using the `getNumDaysBetween()` method of the `Command` class) to an `ArrayList`
object of type `Ingredient`. The ingredients are then sorted by earliest expiring to latest and displayed to the user.

The partial sequence diagram of the above process is shown below:
![image](images/ExpireSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 5. Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* manages food stock and needs to track a significant number of ingredients/ food items (e.g. a restaurant inventory manager)
* is proficient at typing
* is comfortable with CLI apps

**Value proposition**: track large amounts of ingredients simply through typing commands faster than a GUI driven application

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 6. User stories

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|new user|see usage instructions|refer to them when I forget how to use the application|

2. Users proficient at typing should be able to complete tasks faster using commands than using a mouse with a GUI.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 8. Instructions for manual testing

### Setting up 
Refer to the [first time setup section](#2-first-time-setup) and follow the steps to run SITUS on your device. For the following sections, refer to the [user guide](UserGuide.md) for information on how to use the different commands.

### Testing features

#### Adding ingredients
1. Add ingredients using the `add` command with the correct format.
2. Use `list` to ensure ingredients you added are shown.
3. Test case: `add n/NAME a/AMOUNT` <br>
Expected: No ingredient is added and an error message is shown.
4. Try other incorrect add commands with different parameters missing <br>
Expected: Similar to previous.

#### Deleting ingredients
1. Use the same list from the previous section. 
2. Test case: `delete 0` <br>
Expected: No ingredient is deleted and an error message is shown.
3. Test case: `delete 1` <br>
Expected: The first ingredient is deleted.

#### Updating ingredients
1. Similar to adding ingredients, first use `update` correctly for an existing ingredient.
2. Next, test `update` with missing parameters <br>
Expected: No ingredient is updated and an error message is shown.
