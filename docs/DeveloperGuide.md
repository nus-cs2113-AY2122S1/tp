# Developer Guide

## Introducing cOOPer

Welcome to cOOPer's Developer Guide!

cOOPer is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop** application developed to simplify administrative processes of **tech startups** such as **communication** and **finance management**.

cOOPer was developed in **Java 11** following an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** paradigm, hence the letters OOP in its name.

This developer guide is for software designers, developers, and software testers of cOOPer. It will be your reference manual if you are looking to:
- **Know more** about cOOPer's internal **software design**
- **Improve** cOOPer's internal **software design**
- **Add** more features to cOOPer

## Design

> üí° The architecture diagram and _UML_ diagrams in this document were created using **draw.io**. The `.png` templates used to create the diagrams can be found in the [`developerGuideDiagrams`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/docs/developerGuideDiagrams) folder. 
> To create and edit diagrams, access the draw.io [website](https://app.diagrams.net/), select 'Open Existing Diagram' and open the desired `.png` file. Any changes to the diagram will be saved automatically.

### Overview

cOOPer consists of two main layers: the _**verification** layer_ and the _**features** layer_ as shown in the diagram below.
cOOPer recognizes different sets of inputs at each layer.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/layerDiagram.png" alt="layerDiagram"><br>
</p> 

Upon launching the app, the user starts at the _**verification** layer_ where they can only [log in](UserGuide.md#logging-in-login) or [register](UserGuide.md#registration). 
Entering valid credentials will then grant the user access to the _**features** layer_ where they can input commands to use cOOPer's features. 
At this layer, entering the `logout` command will bring the user back to the _verification layer_.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Architecture

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/architectureDiagram.png" alt="architectureDiagram"><br>
</p> 

The **Architecture Diagram** above shows the high-level design of cOOPer and how cOOPer's components are connected.

`Cooper` contains the main method of the program. `Cooper`'s responsibilities are as such:
- Upon **launching the app**, `Cooper` initializes the components and loads stored user data into the components. 
- While the **app is running**, `Cooper` reads user input which is then processed by the components to produce a result.
- Upon **shutting down the app**, `Cooper` shuts down the components and performs cleaning up where necessary. 

Apart from `Cooper`, the rest of the app consists of these seven components:
- [`Ui`](#ui-component): Handles the reading of user input and printing of messages to the terminal.
- [`Parser`](#parser-component): Interprets and validates user input.
- [`Verification`](#verification-component): Verifies that the user is signing in to cOOPer with valid credentials.
- [`Command`](#command-component): Executes commands which are parsed from user input.
- [`Resources`](#resources-component): Manages data for cOOPer's finance, meetings and forum features while the app is running.
- [`Storage`](#storage-component): Loads data from, and saves data to storage files in the computer hard disk.
- [`Util`](#util-component): Provides utility which help with some of cOOPer's features.

#### Interaction of the architecture components to process user input
- The sequence diagram below provides a general overview of how cOOPer's components interact with each other when a user enters their **sign in details** at the _**verification layer**_.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`userInput` represents the credentials input by the user for verification. For example, `register John /pw 12345 /as admin`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/signInSequenceDiagram.png" alt="signInSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p> 

- The next sequence diagram below provides a general overview of how cOOPer's components interact with each other when a user enters a **command** at the _**features layer**_.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `userInput` represents a command input by the user. For example, `meetings`.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`XYZCommand` is an object representing a command recognised by cOOPer. For example, `MeetingsCommand`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/commandSequenceDiagram.png" alt="commandSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Ui Component

**API**: [`cooper.ui`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/ui)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/uiComponent.png" alt="uiComponent"><br>
</p> 

- The `Ui` component consists of a parent `Ui` class and its subclasses as shown by the class diagram above.
- The parent `Ui` class contains general constants and methods used across cOOPer's components which read user input and print recurring messages.
- On the other hand, the subclasses for the different components in cOOPer (`ABCUi`) contain constants and methods specific to the function of that component. 
For example, `FinanceUi` contains a method `printBalanceSheet()` which prints a balance sheet formatted with headers containing the entries input by the user.
- The classes in the `Ui` component have *static* methods so `Cooper` does not need to contain a reference to `Ui`.

The `Ui` component:
- Reads in user input from the terminal.
- Prints status messages, error messages and messages prompting the user for input.
- Displays a label besides cOOPer's prompt to indicate which stage of cOOPer the user is in. For example, the `[Logged out]` label indicates that the user is currently logged out of cOOPer.
- Is used by `Verification` and `Cooper` mainly for reading user input, while it is used by `Resources` mainly for printing output messages.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-developer-guide)

### Parser Component

**API**: [`cooper.parser`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/parser)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/parserComponent.png" alt="parserComponent"><br>
</p>

- The `Parser` component consists of an abstract `ParserBase` class with its subclasses, `CommandParser` and `SignInDetailsParser`. 
- To emphasize the different [layers](#overview) of cOOPer, different types of objects are constructed from user input at different layers. 
User input at the _verification layer_ will be parsed to construct a `SignInProtocol` object while user input at the _features layer_ will be parsed to construct a `Command` object. 
- The `SignInProtocol` object executes the signing in of the user with details provided while the `Command` object executes the command input by the user.
- `ParserBase` contains a reference to the `Parser` *interface* from the [dopsun chatbot-cli](https://github.com/dopsun/chatbot-cli) library used by cOOPer. 
More information about cOOPer's implementation of the library can be found [here](#parsing-user-input).

The `Parser`component:
- Constructs and returns a new `SignInProtocol` / `Command` object with the correct parsed attributes.
- Determines if user input corresponds to any of the commands recognised by cOOPer.
- Validates user input by checking for erroneous command arguments. For example, empty command arguments or entering alphabets where an integer is expected are regarded as erroneous arguments.
- Does not perform any printing of error messages, but instead throws `InvalidCommandFormatException`, `UnrecognisedCommandException` etc. to signal erroneous input.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-developer-guide)

### Verification Component

**API**: [`cooper.verification`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/verification)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/verificationComponent.png" alt="verificationComponent"><br>
</p>

- The `Verification` component consists of a `Verifier` class which contains the list of registered users and methods to verify user credentials.
- The `SignInProtocol` class is an abstract class representing one of the two sign in protocols, `Login` or `Registration`. 
- The `SignInProtocol` class contains a reference to a `SignInDetails` object which as a whole, represents a **sign in attempt** by the user using one of the two protocols, with the corresponding `SignInDetails`.
For example, a `Login` object containing `SignInDetailsX` represents the user's login attempt with the details `SignInDetailsX`.
- `Login` and `Registration` override `SignInProtocol`'s abstract method, `executeSignIn()` as there are different conditions to check depending on whether the user is trying to log in or register. More on the verification process can be found [here](#verifying-user-credentials).

The `Verification` component:
- Verifies that the user is signing in to cOOPer with valid credentials.
- Grants the user access to the _features layer_ if the user's credentials are valid. A user with valid credentials means the user is logging in to cOOPer with the same username, password and role they registered with.

### Command Component

**API**: [`Command.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/cooper/command/Command.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/commandComponent.png" alt="commandComponent"><br>
</p>

- The `Command` component consists of an abstract `Command` class and its subclasses as shown in the diagram above.
- Each subclass (`ABCCommand`) overrides `Command`'s abstract method, `execute()` and has its own unique implementation of the method based on how the command is to be executed.
- This makes the addition of a new command to cOOPer relatively easy. For example, you can define a `HelloCommand` which prints out `Hello world!` by inheriting from `Command` and implementing the `execute()` method as such:

```java
public class HelloCommand extends Command {
	// constructors and attributes for execution of the command are omitted
	public void execute() {
		System.out.println("Hello world!");
	}
}
```

- Some subclasses contain extra attributes which are parsed from the arguments in the user input. 
- These attributes aid in the execution of the command.
For example, the [`ScheduleCommand`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/cooper/command/ScheduleCommand.java) contains a `String` representing the meeting name as well as an `ArrayList` representing the users associated with that meeting.
- The `execute()` method takes in a `SignInDetails` object as a parameter. This object represents the sign in details of a user who has successfully signed in to cOOPer. For some of cOOPer's finance / meetings features which are only accessible by an _admin_, the `UserRole` attribute of this `SignInDetails` object is checked to grant correct access to the feature.

The `Command` component:
- Executes a command entered by the user
- May make changes to the objects in the [`Resources`](#resources-component) component depending on the command.
- Performs the storage of data via the [`Storage`](#storage-component) component if there is any change to the data after the command is executed successfully.
- Prints status messages or error messages to the output via the [`Ui`](#ui-component) component to inform the user of the status of command execution.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-developer-guide)

### Resources Component

**API**: [`cooper.resources`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/resources)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/resourcesComponent.png" alt="resourcesComponent"><br>
</p>

- The `Resources` component contains `ResourcesManager` which manages access rights to feature managers based on `UserRole`.


  - E.g. the following line will only return a valid reference to `FinanceManager` if `userRole == UserRole.ADMIN`. Otherwise, `null` will be returned indicating the user does not have the access right to that module.

    ```
    FinanceManager financeManager = resourcesManager.getFinanceManager(userRole);
    ```


- It also implements a *give-receive* pattern to pass private members of `ResourcesManager` class to `StorageManager` safely. This is because `StorageManager` has "super privilege" to access internal data structures of feature managers and save to/ load from hard disk. 

The `Resources` component:

- Returns references of feature managers such as `MeetingManager`, `FinanceManager` or `ForumManager` based on `UserRole` of the request body. E.g. Only an *admin* is able to get `FinanceManager` successfully.
- Returns references to `StorageManager` safely upon request.

#### Finance

**API**: [`cooper.finance`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/finance)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/financeComponent.png" alt="financeComponent"><br>
</p>

+ The `Finance` component contains the `FinanceManager`, `BalanceSheet`, `CashFlow`, and `Projection` classes, as well as the `FinanceCommand` enumeration.
+ The `FinanceManager` constructs the instances of the `BalanceSheet`, `CashFlow` and `Projection` for use, and contains attributes and methods that aid the related functions.
+ The `FinanceCommamnd` enum helps the `Parser` to understand what `Finance` function is being used, with three states: `CF`, `BS`, and `IDLE`.
+ The `Finance` component also contains the `PdfGenerator` class (not shown in the diagram above) for the `generate` feature. More info on this feature can be found [here](#generating-a-pdf-from-the-financial-statement).

The `Finance` component:
+ Handles adding / listing / generating of balance sheets, cash flow statements, and free cash flow projections.
+ Assists the parser in identifying which function is being used at any given time.

<!--@@author fansxx-->

#### Meetings

**API**: [`cooper.meetings`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/meetings)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/meetingsComponent.png" alt="meetingsComponent"><br>
</p>

The `Meetings` component contains the `MeetingManager` and `Meeting` classes.

`MeetingManager` stores **two** attributes:
1. the **timings** along with the **usernames** of the available users, which is a `TreeMap<LocalTime, ArrayList<String>>` object,
2. the **list of meetings** scheduled, which is an `ArrayList<Meeting>` object.

The `MeetingManager` constructs the instances of `Meeting`, and stores it as an `ArrayList<Meeting>` in itself.

The `Meetings` component:

+ Handles the **declaration of availability**
+ Assists in  the **scheduling** of meetings
+ Lists the current availability and meetings

<!--@@author Rrraaaeee-->

#### Forum

**API**: [`cooper.forum`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/forum)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/forumComponent.png" alt="forumComponent"><br>
</p>

+ The `Forum` component contains a `ForumManager`, `ForumPost` , `ForumComment` and `ForumPostBase`. Both `ForumPost` and `ForumComment` are inherited from abstract base class `ForumPostBase` as they contain the attributes `content` and `username`. 
+ Forum posts are stored in a hierarchical way where `ForumManager` keeps a list of `ForumPost`s and each `ForumPost` keeps a list of `ForumComment`s.

The `Forum` component:

+ Handles the adding / deleting / listing of posts and comments
+ Deletes a post or comment only if the user requesting the action owns the post or comment, i.e. the `username` of the request body must match the `username` field of the post or comment.

### Storage Component

**API**: [`cooper.storage`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/storage)

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/storageComponent.png" alt="storageComponent"><br>
</p>

- The `Storage` component consists of a parent `Storage` class along with its subclasses as shown in the diagram above.
- The `Storage` class contains a `filePath` attribute representing the path of the file where the data is to be stored. It also contains methods common to all its subclasses such as `getScanner()` and `createFileInDirectory()` which aid in the process of writing to and creating the storage file.
- `Cooper` contains a reference to a `StorageManager` object. This `StorageManager` object in turn contains references to each of the subclasses of `Storage` which store cOOPer's data in the [`Verification`](#verification-component) and [`Resources`](#resources-component) components.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èWe do not put the `StorageManager` class under `Resources` for the following reasons:<br>
> 1. `Storage` class is cOOPer's internal construct for bookkeeping various internal data structures and recovering them at startup. This does not categorise under any features the user can interact with and hence should not be kept under `ResourcesManager`.
> 2. `Storage` has super privileges to access internal data structures of all components in `Resources`. This contradicts the goal of `ResourcesManager` which is to manage access rights to different features depending on user roles, and hence should be kept separate from it.

The `Storage` component:
- Loads stored user data from the storage file specified by `filePath` into the `Verifier`, `FinanceManager`, `MeetingsManager` and `ForumManager` objects upon launching the app.
- Saves data to the storage file specified by `filePath` from the `Verifier`, `FinanceManager`, `MeetingsManager` and `ForumManager` whenever a change is made to the data in these objects.

### Util Component

**API**: [`Util.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/cooper/util/Util.java)

- The `Util` component is a component unrelated to cOOPer and serves mainly as a helper component to make some of cOOPer's features possible.
- There are only two methods in the `Util` class, namely `inputStreamToTmpFile()` and `inputStreamToString()`. 
- `inputStreamToTmpFile()` is used to recreate the dopsun chatbot-cli's training files (originally located in `src/main/resources/parser`). 
In the process of packaging cOOPer into a JAR application, these training files are converted to bytes which are unable to be read in by the chatbot API. Hence, there is a need to recreate these files for the chatbot to work.
- `inputStreamToString()` is used for cOOPer's [`generate`](UserGuide.md#generating-a-pdf-from-the-financial-statement--generate) feature which allows the user to generate a PDF file from data in cOOPer's balance sheet or cash flow statement. 
This method is used to convert the `.tex` template files (located in `src/main/resources/pdf`) into a `String` object which can then be handled easily in the code. More details of the implementation can be found [here](#generating-a-pdf-from-the-financial-statement).

## Implementation

### Parsing user input

cOOPer uses the [dopsun chatbot-cli](https://github.com/dopsun/chatbot-cli) library as its frontend parser that allows you to define any arbitrary *input schema* under `src/main/resources/parser/command-data.properties` 
such as 

```
login = login ${username-hint} /pw ${password-hint} /as ${role-hint}
```

The chatbot's `Parser` library automatically parses the place-holders defined with `$` leaders to strings. For example, `login Yvonne /pw 12345 /as admin` will be parsed 
into the following fields:

```python
{ "username-hint" : Yvonne,
  "password-hint" : 12345,
  "role-hint" : admin }
```

This gives great flexibility and extensibility to the `Parser` component as you do not need to worry about writing new parsing schemes for every command and adding new commands to cOOPer for new features become trivial.

### Verifying user credentials
The `Verifier` class facilitates the verification of the credentials of a user registering or logging in to cOOPer.

#### Verification process

Different conditions are checked depending on whether a user is trying to log in or register. For example, if a user is trying to register, cOOPer will check if the username is already registered and asks the user to log in if they are not registered yet.
On the other hand, if an unregistered user is trying to log in, cOOPer will ask the user to register first.

For a registered user trying to log in, cOOPer will first check if the entered password is correct. This is done with the help of the `PasswordHasher` class which hashes the entered password with the user's salt stored by cOOPer. The hash obtained will then be compared to the user's stored hash to determine if the entered password is correct.

If the password is correct, the user's role will then be checked to determine if they are logging in with the role they registered with.

#### Registering a user
The following sequence diagram shows the detailed process of registering a user.
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`userInput` is `register John /pw 123 /as admin`.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èThe `executeSignIn()` method actually takes in a `rawPassword` as its parameters but is omitted in this sequence diagram as the registration process does not require the raw password of the user.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/registrationSequenceDiagram.png" alt="registrationSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

The `SignInDetailsParser` constructs a `SignInDetails` object parsed from the arguments in `userInput`. This `SignInDetails` object is then used to construct a `Registration` object which executes the registration of the user. This process is shown by the sequence diagram below.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/refFrameRegistration.png" alt="refFrameSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

#### Logging in
Assuming that the above registration has taken place successfully, the following sequence diagram shows the login process of the user.
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`userInput` is `login John /pw 123 /as admin`.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èThe process of parsing `userInput` takes place similar to when a user is registering. The reference frame is omitted in this sequence diagram for simplicity.

</p>

#### Hashing user passwords
The Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2) hashing algorithm is used for hashing user passwords. This algorithm is used together with a 64-bit salt text for each password before it is hashed to improve security and decrease susceptibility to rainbow-table attacks, where duplicate user passwords are still stored securely.

This algorithm is recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for password storage and our implementation also adheres to NIST specifications: <br>
- The hashing algorithm is run for 25000 iterations while NIST only specifies a minimum of 10000 iterations.
- A 64-bit salt text is used while NIST specifies a 32-bit salt text.

### Requesting a resource

The `Resources` component manages the access rights to other manager components like the `FinanceManager`, `MeetingManager` and `ForumManager`. The following sequence diagram shows the two main operations of `ResourcesManager`:

+ To get a feature manager, such as the `FinanceManager`, the user needs to pass in their `UserRole`. `ResourcesManager` will check if the user has the right access to the feature and returns the requested object if so, and `null` otherwise.
+ The `StorageManager` class has "super privilege" to access internal data structure of `FinanceManager`, `MeetingManager` and `ForumManager`. Private members are passed safely using the *give-receive* pattern, instead of universal `getters`.

### Interacting with finance functions
The `Finance` component provides features such as **adding** and **listing** of financial statements, i.e. the balance sheet and cash flow statement as well as **compounded projection** of Free Cash Flow growth.

#### Adding to the financial statement
The sequence diagram below illustrates the process of **adding** to a given financial statement, in this case the balance sheet.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/financeSequenceDiagram.png" alt="financeSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

When the user wants to add an entry to a financial statement, `FinanceManager` will first determine if the amount should reflect as **positive** or **negative** in the financial statement, as well as **which section** of the financial statement the entry belongs to. `FinanceManager` will then add the entry to the respective financial statement and its section's net amount.

#### Viewing the financial statement
When the user wants to view a financial statement with `list`, `FinanceManager` will run a check that the net amounts of each section of the financial statement are calculated correctly before the statement is displayed to the output.

#### Projecting cash flow
When the user wants to project free cash flow, `FinanceManager` will first help to calculate free cash flow by subtracting the CapEx (Capital Expenditure: a field of the cash flow statement) from the total cash from Operating Activities. Subsequently `FinanceManager` will compare this value to the previous year's value, and calculate the percentage increase. This percentage increase will then be used in a recursive [periodic compound interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_interest) formula to calculate the following year's free cash flow, at the same percentage increase.

### Generating a PDF from the financial statement
The [`PdfGenerator`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/cooper/finance/pdfgenerator/PdfGenerator.java) abstract class is responsible for the generation of the financial statement as a PDF via the `generate` command. It is inherited by the subclasses, `BalanceSheetGenerator` and `CashFlowStatementGenerator`, with each subclass containing different methods to add different sections to the PDF.

#### Creating the PDF with LaTeX
The PDF is generated with the help of an online LaTeX compiler. The LaTeX (`.tex`) templates for the PDF can be found under `src/main/resources/pdf`. The `PdfGenerator` class employs the use of the `inputStreamToString()` method of the [`Util`](#util-component) component to convert the contents of these LaTeX templates into a `String` object. The LaTeX template, which is now a `String` is then manipulated by calling Java `String` methods like `replace()` and `append()`.
Certain identifiers (in the form of LaTeX comments '`%`') in the LaTeX template will be replaced by the actual values of cOOPer's financial statement.

The example below shows the template of an entry in the financial statement:

```
\centering
% {Description}
& \centering
& \centering
& \centering
& % {Amount}
\\[3ex]
```

Calling `replace("% {Description}", "Depreciation and Amortisation")` and `replace("% {Amount}", 1500)` on the template above will result in the following:

```
\centering
Depreciation and Amortisation
& \centering
& \centering
& \centering
& 1500
\\[3ex]
```

When compiled, the LaTeX code above will correspond to an entry 'Depreciation and Amortisation' on the PDF with the amount $1500. This technique can be used on the header and summary templates which will format the header and summary of a particular section in the financial statement.

The methods `createHeader()`, `createEntry()` and `createSummary()` in `PdfGenerator` perform the text replacement as shown above. The diagram below shows how these methods correspond to the different parts of the 'Operating Activities' section in the cash flow statement PDF.

<p align="center">
    <img width="750" src="developerGuideDiagrams/pdfSections.png" alt="pdfSections"><br>
</p>

#### Compiling the LaTeX code online
`createHeader()`, `createEntry()` and `createSummary()` also add the template to an `ArrayList` after performing the text replacement on the template. Iterating through the `ArrayList`, these templates are then appended together using `append()`.
This forms a long `String` which is then sent to the online LaTeX compiler via a POST request. The reply data obtained from the request is used to construct the PDF via the `write()` method of Java's `FileOutputStream` class.

### Declaring an availability
The `MeetingManager` class facilitates the storing of availability in cOOPer.

#### Availability declaration process
When the user declares an availability, the `addAvailability` function in `MeetingManager` performs some checks before successfully storing their availability.
1. `addAvailability` looks at the format of the `[date]` and `[time]` entered, which will be checked using the `isValidDateTimeFormat` function.
2. `addAvailability` checks if the time entered is at the **start of the hour**, using the `isStartOfHour` function.
3. `addAvailability` checks if the user has already entered their availability under the same date and time, by checking all the names under the specified date and time in the `availability` TreeMap.

The following sequence diagram shows the detailed process of declaring an availability. `username` is `Sebastian` and `userInput` is `available 11-08-2021 14:00`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/availableSequenceDiagram.png" alt="availableSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-developer-guide)

### Scheduling a meeting
The `MeetingManager` class facilitates the scheduling of meetings.

#### Scheduling process
When the user schedules a meeting `ScheduleCommand` checks if the `[date]` and `[time]` parameter is entered and calls `manualScheduleMeeting` in `MeetingManager` if it is and `autoScheduleMeeting` if it isn't.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of **automatically** scheduling a meeting. `username` of the user scheduling is `Sebastian` and `userInput` is `schedule Project Meeting /with Eugene`.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/autoScheduleSequenceDiagram.png" alt="autoScheduleSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows the process of **manually** scheduling a meeting. `username` of the user scheduling is `Sebastian` and `userInput` is `schedule Project Meeting /with Eugene /at 11-08-2021 14:00`.

### Interacting with the forum

The following sequence diagram shows three operations with the forum, `addPost`, `commentPost` and `deletePost`.

+ For adding a post, `ForumManager` will create a new `ForumPost` object and store its username and content.

+ For commenting on a post, `ForumManager` will first check if the `postId` specified is a valid index. If it is not, an exception will be thrown. Otherwise, it will get the `ForumPost` by its `postId` and add a new `ForumComment` to it.

+ For deleting a post, `ForumManager` will again check the `postId` and delete the post only if the `postId` is valid.

  > ‚ÑπÔ∏è In the actual implementation, `ForumManager` will also ensure the username of the user requesting for the `deletePost` operation matches the *owner* of the forum post. This checking is omitted in this sequence diagram for simplicity and represented as the method call to`remove(postId)`.

### Saving and loading data
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èDue to the way the `Storage` component is implemented, the classes and methods used for storage have names which are quite similar. In order to generalize the explanations in this section for how data is saved and loaded, the term `XYZ` will be used as a placeholder where `XYZ` is `signInDetails`, `balanceSheet`, `cashFlowStatement`, `availability`, `meetings` and `forum`.

The `StorageManager` class facilitates the saving and loading of cOOPer's data to and from its storage files. This data includes the sign in details of registered users (from the [`Verification`](#verification-component) component) , entries of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, list of availabilities, scheduled meetings, and forum posts (all from the [`Resources`](#resources-component) component).
cOOPer's data is stored separately in multiple text files named `XYZ.txt` located in the 'cooperData' folder in the home folder.

#### Saving data
Certain commands, when executed successfully, can change the data in the `Verification` and `Resources` components. (e.g. `register`, `add`, `available`, etc.) Whenever the data in these components change, the command that made the change will call the `saveXYZ()` method of the `StorageManager` to update the storage file with the change. 
For example, when a new availability is added successfully, the method `saveAvailability()` is called by `AvailableCommand` and the storage file is updated with the new list of availabilities.

The following sequence diagram shows the general procedure of saving data to the storage file whenever a change is made.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/saveDataSequenceDiagram.png" alt="saveDataSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

#### Loading data
Data is loaded from cOOPer's storage files into the `Verification` and `Resources` component upon launching the app. The `StorageManager` constructor is first called and each subclass `XYZStorage` is initialized with the file paths of their storage files, `XYZ.txt`.
The `loadAllData()` method of `StorageManager` is then called and this method in turn calls the `loadXYZ()` methods of the `XYZStorage` subclasses. If the storage files are not present upon launching cOOPer, the storage files will be created and any error in file creation will be made known to the user. 
Since data in the storage files are of a specific format, any change to the storage format will throw an `InvalidFileDataException` and a message will be printed to specify the file containing invalid data. 

The following sequence diagram shows the general procedure of loading data from the storage file upon launching cOOPer.

<p align="center">
    <img src="developerGuideDiagrams/loadDataSequenceDiagram.png" alt="loadDataSequenceDiagram"><br>
</p>

#### Storage design considerations
**Current choice**: Individual subclasses which store the sign in details of registered users, entries of the balance sheet and cash flow statement, list of availabilities, scheduled meetings, and forum posts in separate storage files.
- Pros:
  - Easy to implement
  - Efficient (only saves the data changed for a specific component, not all)
  - Extensible (each subclass follows a certain template for storage)
- Cons:
  - Some methods are duplicated (e.g. `saveXYZ()`, `loadXYZ()`, etc.)
