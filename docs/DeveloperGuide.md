## Design
### Architecture
![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The _Architecture Diagram_ shown above illustrates the high-level design of the Application.

**Overview of components**
* `Main`
  * On app launch: Creates and runs an instance of `Taa`.
* `Taa`
  * On creation: Initializes the `UI` and `Storage` components.
  * On run: Loads persistent data from `Storage`, receives user input from `UI`, and uses `Parser` to parse the user input.
* `UI`
  * Handles UI operations.
* `Parser`
  * Handles input parsing and determines which command to run.
* `Command`
  * Defines how a command is to be executed.
* `ClassList`
  * Contains a list of `TeachingClass` objects currently being managed by the app.
* `Util`
  * Contains useful methods (e.g. Check if a string is integer/double, convert string to integer/double).
* `Storage`
  * Handles data storage operations (e.g. Reading from and writing to data file).

<br>

**Interaction between components**
![ArchitectureSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The _Architecture Sequence Diagram_ shown above shows how the components usually interact with each other.

<br>

### Taa Component
![TaaClassDiagram](diagrams/class/TaaClassDiagram.png)

The `Taa` class is the starting point of the application. It stores a `ClassList` object which represents the current
classes that the application is keeping track of. It also initialises the `Ui` and `Storage` objects to handle user
interactions and persistent data storage respectively.

<br>

### Ui Component
![UiClassDiagram](diagrams/class/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `Ui` class handles all user interactions in the application.

`Ui` implements the following functionalities:
* Print messages with a standard output format.
* Print exception messages with a standard output format.
* Read user input through the `getUserInput` method.

<br>

### Parser Component
![ParserClassDiagram](diagrams/class/ParserClassDiagram.png)

The `Parser` class provides methods to parse a user input and returns a `Command` object which represents the command that
the user wishes to execute, and verify the validity of a value or provided by the user or read from `Storage`.

`Parser` implements the following functionalities:
* Parse a user input string and returning the respective `Command` object.
* Check if a value is valid (e.g. Does not contain any illegal characters).

<br>

### Command Component
![CommandClassDiagram](diagrams/class/CommandClassDiagram.png)

The `Command` class is an _abstract_ class inherited by other command classes such as `AddClassCommand`, `EditClassCommand`,
`DeleteClassCommand`, `HelpCommand`, etc.

`Command` implements the following functionalities:
* Check the validity of arguments provided by the user through the `checkArgument` method.
* Perform the logic of the command run by the user through the `execute` method.
* Return a string representing the different command usage syntax.

<br>

### ClassList Component
![ClassListClassDiagram](diagrams/class/ClassListClassDiagram.png)

The `ClassList` class contains data of all classes saved within it. It provides methods to allow other classes to access
the various data within it.

`ClassList` implements the following functionalities:
* Add/Delete `TeachingClass` objects within the list.
* Return all `TeachingClass` objects within the list.

<br>

### AssessmentList Component
![AssessmentListClassDiagram](diagrams/assessment/AssessmentListClassDiagram.png)

The `Assessment` class contains data of all assessments saved within it. It provides methods to allow other classes to access
the various data within it.

`AssessmentList` implements the following functionalities:
* Add/Delete `AssessmentList` objects within the list.
* Return all `AssessmentList` objects within the list.

<br>

### Util Component
![UtilClassDiagram](diagrams/class/UtilClassDiagram.png)

The `Util` class provides common utility methods.

`Util` implements the following functionalities:
* Check if string can be converted to `int`, `double`, or `boolean`.
* Create a file (including its parent directories, if necessary).
* Check if file exists.
* Check if path is a file or folder.
* Return the absolute path of given a path.

<br>

### Storage Component
![StorageClassDiagram](diagrams/class/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class handles all data file operations in the application. It depends on the `StorageDeserializer` to
deserialize the data read from the JSON file. `StorageDeserializer` is an _abstract_ class inherited by other deserializer
classes such as `ClassListDeserializer`, `TeachingClassDeserializer`, `StudentListDeserializer`, etc.

`Storage` implements the following functionalities:
* Save `ClassList` into a JSON file.
* Read and parse JSON file into a `ClassList` object.
* Filter out invalid data read from the JSON file.

<br>

## Implementation
### Add Class
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_class` command works:
![AddClassSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add class feature behaves at each step:<br>
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_class i/CS2113T-F12 n/Tutorial Group F12` to add a class. The `add_class` command calls the
`AddClassCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - Within `AddClassCommand.execute`, `ClassList.getClassWithId("CS2113T-F12")` is called to ensure that
there is no existing class with ID `CS2113T-F12`.
* Step 3 - If no existing class with ID `CS2113T-F12` is found, a new `TeachingClass` object with ID and name set to `CS2113T-F12`
and `Tutorial Group F12` respectively.
* Step 4 - Then, `ClassList.addClass` is called to add the newly created `TeachingClass` object into the `classes` ArrayList
within `ClassList`.

<br>

### Add Student
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_student` command works:
![AddStudentSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add student feature behaves at each step:<br>
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_student c/CS2113T-F12 i/A0217978J n/Jonny Lims` to add a student. The `add_student` 
  command calls the `AddStudentCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - Within `AddStudentCommand.execute`, `ClassList.getClassWithId("CS2113T-F12")` is 
  called to ensure that there is an existing class with ID `CS2113TT-F12`.
* Step 3 - If an existing class with code `CS2113T-F12` is found, a new `Student` object with id and name set to 
  `A0217978J` and `Jonny Lims` respectively.
* Step 4 - Then, `StudentList.addStudent` is called to add the newly created `Student` 
  object into the `students` ArrayList within `StudentList`. Below is an object diagram showing the state after 
  completion of the `add_student` command.

<br>

### Add Assessment
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_assessment` command works:
![AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add assessment feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_assessment c/cs2113t n/midterms m/20 w/10` to add an assessment. The `add_assessment`
  command calls the `AddAssessmentCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - Within `AddAssessmentCommand.execute`, `ClassList.getClassWithId("cs2113t")` is called to ensure that there
  is an existing class with code `cs2113t`.
* Step 3 - If an existing class with code `cs2113t` is found, the `MAXIMUM_MARKS` and `WEIGHTAGE` arguments are checked
  to ensure that they are valid.
* Step 4 - If the `MAXIMUM_MARKS` and `WEIGHTAGE` arguments are valid, a new `Assessment` object with name,
  maximum marks and weightage set to `midterms`, `20` and `10` respectively is created under the existing `TeachingClass` with
  code `cs2113t`. Then, `AssessmentList.addAssessment` is called to add the newly created `Assessment` object into the
  `assessments` ArrayList within `AssessmentList`.
* Step 5 - Within `AssessmentList.addAssessment`, the name of the newly created `Assessment` object is checked to ensure
  there is no existing assessment with name `midterms`. At the same time, the weightage of the newly created
  `Assessment` object is also checked to ensure that the total weightage of the assessments in the `cs2113t` class
  will not exceed 100 with the addition of the weightage of the newly created `Assessment` object.
* Step 6 - If the name and weightage of the newly created `Assessment` object are valid, the newly created `Assessment`
  object is added into the `assessments` ArrayList within `AssessmentList`.

<br>

### Set Mark
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `set_mark` command works:
![SetMarkSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/SetMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the set mark feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `set_mark c/CS2113T-F12 s/1 a/Midterms m/60` to set the mark of a student for an assessment.
  The `set_mark` command calls the `SetMarkCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - Within `SetMarkCommand.execute`, `ClassList.getClassWithId("CS2113T-F12")` is called to ensure that there
  is an existing class with code `CS2113T-F12`.
* Step 3 - `ClassList.getStudentList` and `ClassList.getAssessmentList` are called to get the respective lists.
* Step 4 - `assessmentList.getAssessment("Midterms")` is called to retrieve the respective `Assessment` object.
* Step 5 - If the `Assessment` object for `Midterms` exists, `studentList.getStudentAt(1)` is to retrieve the `Student` object.
* Step 6 - If the `Student` object exists, `student.setMarks("Midterms", 60)` is called to set the mark of the student
  for `Midterms`. Below is an object diagram showing the state after completion of the set_mark command.

![SetMarkObjectDiagram](diagrams/object/SetMarkObjectDiagram.png)
#### Marks storage
The `marks` are stored inside each `Student` object under the `results` HashMap, with the `marks` as a value that is 
mapped by the `assessmentName`. We chose to use this way of storage as the `marks` are unique for each `Student` as well
as each `Assessment`. Special consideration was taken to preserve the `marks` if the `Assessment` had the name changed. 
This means that if an `Assessment` had the name changed from `Midterms` to `OP1`, the `assessmentName` key in the 
`results` HashMap of each `Student` would also follow the change.

Q: Why not use Marks as a separate Class? <br>
A: The reason is that the HashMap could accomplish the same thing as a separate `Mark` object. <br>
Detailed here is an alternative implementation using a separate Class to implement `Mark`: <br>
Creating a `Mark` object to fit our purposes would require creation of a `MarkList` as an attribute in `Student` which 
would store the `Mark` objects in an ArrayList. The `Mark` object would then contain the `assessmentName` as a String 
and `mark` as a double attribute. The `MarkList` would be empty in the beginning and only be populated by 
`SetMarkCommand`, which would create a new`Mark` object when called. To ensure that the same `Assessment` does not have 
two different `Mark` objects, a check would have to be done using a getter function that depends on the `assessmentName`
attribute in `Mark` to retrieve any currently existing objects with the same `assessmentName` as the input. The creation
of the new `Mark` object would only proceed if the getter retrieves a null. In order to have the implementation of 
changing the `assessmentName` whenever an `Assessment` object has its `name` attribute changed, one can simply use the
same getter as above to retrieve the `Mark` object with the old `assessmentName` and call a setter to change it to the
new `assessmentName`.
Included below are an updated Class and Object Diagram showing this implementation. <br>ClassDiagram:<br>

### Set Attendance
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `set_attendance` command works:
![SetAttendanceSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/SetAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the set attendance feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `set_attendance c/CS2113T-F12 s/1-3 l/1 p/1` to set an attendance to `Present` for students 
at index `1-3`, lesson number `1`. The `set_attendance` command calls the `setAttendanceCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - The range of student indexes or selected student indexes are transformed into an array of the consisting
student indexes. In this case, a `studentIndexArray` [1,2,3] is set using the `setStudentIndexes` method.
* Step 3a - If no existing attendance object with lesson number `1` for student at index `1` is found, a new 
`attendance` object with lesson number `1` and attendance record `Present` is set as its lesson number and attendance 
record respectively.
* Step 3b - Otherwise, the existing attendance record of the `attendance` object with student at index `1` and lesson 
number `1` is set to `Present`.
* Step 4 - `attendanceList.addAttendance` is called to add the newly created `attendance` object into the `attendances` 
ArrayList within `attendanceList`.
* Step 5 - Steps 2-4 are repeated for each element in the `studentIndexArray`. For our example, steps 2-4 are repeated 
for students at index `2` and `3`. <br>

different lessons. The `list_attendance` command calls the `listAttendanceCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - `classList.getClassWithId` is called to obtain the `teachingClass` object with `classId` `CS2113T-F12`.
* Step 3 - `teachingClass.getStudentList` is called to obtain `studentList` object, containing the ArrayList of students
for the class.
* Step 4 - `studentList.getStudentAt` is called to obtain the `student` object at `studentIndex` `1`.

Below is an example scenario of how the set attendance feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `list_lesson_attendance c/CS2113T-F12 l/1` to list the class attendance for lesson number
`1`. The `list_lesson_attendance` command calls the `listLessonAttendanceCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - `classList.getClassWithId` is called to obtain the `teachingClass` object with `classId` `CS2113T-F12`.
* Step 3 - `teachingClass.getStudentList` is called to obtain `studentList` object, containing the ArrayList of students
  for the class.
* Step 4 - The constructor `LessonAttendanceList()` is called to create a `lessonAttendanceList` object.
* Step 5 - `lessonAttendanceList.setLessonAttendances` is called to populate an ArrayList in the `lessonAttendanceList` 
object with existing student attendances from class `CS2113T-F12`, lesson number `1`.

<br>

### Delete Attendance

Below is an example scenario of how the set attendance feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `delete_attendance c/CS2113T-F12 s/1-3 l/1` to delete an attendance for students
  at index `1-3`, lesson number `1`. The `delete_attendance` command calls the `deleteAttendanceCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - The range of student indexes or selected student indexes are transformed into an array of the consisting
  student indexes. In this case, a `studentIndexArray` [1,2,3] is set using the `setStudentIndexes` method.
* Step 3 - The existing `attendance` object with student at index `1` and lesson number `1` is removed from 
`attendanceList` through the `attendanceList.deleteAttendance` method.
* Step 4 - Steps 2-3 are repeated for each element in the `StudentIndexArray`. For our example, steps 2-4 are repeated
  for students at index `2` and `3`.
