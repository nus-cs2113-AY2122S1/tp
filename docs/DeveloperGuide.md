### Architecture
(Some architecture diagram)
The Architecture diagram above explains the high-level design of the Typists app.  
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main Components of the architecture**
The `Main` class is the entry point of Typist. It is responsible for parsing and running various user's command.

The other core components of Typist:
* `ui`: The Ui of the app.
* `command`: Consists of `CommandFactory` which parses user inputs, and various `command` objects.
* `common`: A collection of classes used by multiple other components.
* `content`: holds the content and logic for `content` command
* `exception`: holds the 


## Implementation

{Describe the design and implementation of the product. Use UML diagrams and short code snippets where applicable.}

### Choose the game content

Once the game starts, the main class instantiates a Content object containing a string, which is set to a default 
value (lorem ipsum paragraph). The string can only be changed through the setContent() method.

Users can input the 'content' command to start the text selection.

There are 3 types:

    1. Opening paragraphs from famous books
    2. Custom Wikipedia article
    3. Random words

The following UML diagram illustrates the way content selection works in the program.

![](diagrams/Content.png)

There only exists one private content string for all sessions. Each time a set method is called, the string is changed 
depending on the choices that the user made throughout the process. Whenever the user starts a game, the getContent() 
method is called and the text is set accordingly.

### Word Limit Game

Once the CommandFactory reads a 'word' command, a word limit game will begin.

### \[Proposed\] View Statistics feature
#### \[Proposed Implementation\]
The top-level logic of view statistics feature resides in ViewCommand. It implements the Command
interface. The key method of the class is `executeCommand()`.  
`executeCommand()` logic:
1. Calls the retrieveStatistics() method of StatisticsManager to get the statistics.
2. Calls the displayStatistics() method of ViewCommandUi to display the statistics retrieved.
<!-- -->
StatisticsManager performs the logic for processing the game records to obtain the statistics.  
Its key methods are:  
* `retrieveStatistics()` - Decides which of the three methods below to run
* `calculateBestStatistics()` - Returns the best statistics over the past n games
* `calculateWorstStatistics()` - Returns the worst statistics over the past n games
* `calculateAverageStatistics()` - Returns the average statistics over the past n games
<!-- -->
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the program implements the feature.

Step 1: The user launches the application (scenario assumes that there are several game records already stored in the text files). 

Step 2: The user executes `view -m best -g time -n 4` to view his/her best statistics for the time-limited game mode over the past 4 games. 

Step 3: A ViewCommand object is then instantiated.  

![Alt text](diagrams/ViewStatistics-1.drawio.svg)

Step 4. ViewCommand calls the retrieveStatistics() method of StatisticsManager.  
![Alt text](diagrams/ViewStatistics-2.drawio.svg)

Step 5: StatisticsManager creates a GameRecordsManager object.
* The constructor of GameRecordsManager calls the readGameRecords() method of the Storage class to retrieve the gamer's past game records from the text files.
<!-- -->
![Alt text](diagrams/ViewStatistics-3.drawio.svg)  
Step 6. StatisticsManager then calls getGamesRecords() method of GameRecordsManager() and self-invokes calculateBestStatistics().
* Calculated statistics is returned.

Step 7. ViewCommand calls the displayStatistics() method of the ViewCommandUi class to display the statistics.

The following sequence diagram shows how the above scenario is executed.

#### Alternative Implementation
* One implementation considered is to do away with the retrieveStatistics() method and immediately call one of calculateBestStatistics,
calculateWorstStatistics() or calculateAverageStatistics() based on the gamer's imput using a switch statement. This implementation choice 
was not used because it violates the Single Responsibility Principle and does not do SLAP well.
* Another implementation considered was for GameRecordsManager to do the main logic. This implementation was not done as it violates the
Single Responsibility Principle.
