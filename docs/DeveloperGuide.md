## Design
### Architecture
![ArchitectureDiagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The _Architecture Diagram_ shown above illustrates the high-level design of the Application.

**Overview of components**
* `Main`
  * On app launch: Creates and runs an instance of `Taa`.
* `UI`
  * Handles UI operations.
* `Taa`
  * On creation: Initializes the `UI` and `Storage` components.
  * On run: Loads persistent data from `Storage`, receives user input from `UI`, and uses `Parser` to parse the user input.
* `Parser`
  * Handles input parsing and determines which command to run.
* `Command`
  * Defines how a command is to be executed.
* `ClassList`
  * Contains a list of `TeachingClass` objects currently being managed by the app.
* `Util`
  * Contains useful methods (e.g. Check if a string is integer/double, convert string to integer/double).
* `Storage`
  * Handles data storage operations (e.g. Reading from and writing to data file).

<br>

**Interaction between components**
![ArchitectureSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The _Architecture Sequence Diagram_ shown above shows how the components usually interact with each other.

<br>

### Ui Component
![UiClassDiagram](diagrams/class/UiClassDiagram.png)

The `Ui` class handles all user interactions in the application.

`Ui` implements the following functionalities:
* Print messages with a standard output format.
* Print exception messages with a standard output format.
* Read user input through the `getUserInput` method.

<br>

### Parser Component
![ParserClassDiagram](diagrams/class/ParserClassDiagram.png)

The `Parser` class provides methods to parse a user input and return a `Command` object which represents the command that
the user wishes to execute, and verify the validity of a value or provided by the user or read from `Storage`.

`Parser` implements the following functionalities:
* Parse a user input string and returning the respective `Command` object.
* Check if a value is valid (e.g. Does not contain any illegal characters).

<br>

### Command Component
![CommandClassDiagram](diagrams/class/CommandClassDiagram.png)

The `Command` class is an _abstract_ class inherited by other `Command` classes such as `AddClassCommand`, `EditClassCommand`,
`DeleteClassCommand`, `HelpCommand`, etc.

`Command` implements the following functionalities:
* Check the validity of arguments provided by the user through the `checkArgument` method.
* Perform the logic of the command run by the user through the `execute` method.

<br>

### ClassList Component
TODO

<br>

### Util Component
TODO

<br>

### Storage Component
![StorageClassDiagram](diagrams/class/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` class handles all data file operations in the application. It depends on the `ClassListDeserializer` to
deserialize the data read from the JSON file.

`Storage` implements the following functionalities:
* Save `ClassList` into a JSON file.
* Read and parse JSON file into a `ClassList` object.
* Filter out invalid data read from the JSON file.

<br>

## Implementation
### Add Class
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_class` command works:
![AddClassSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddClassSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add class feature behaves at each step:<br>
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_class i/CS2113T-F12 n/Tutorial Group F12` to add a class. The `add_class` command calls the
`AddClassCommand.execute` method.
* Step 2 - Within `AddClassCommand.execute`, `ClassList.getModule("CS2113T-F12")` is called to ensure that
there is no existing class with ID `CS2113T-F12`.
* Step 3 - If no existing class with ID `CS2113T-F12` is found, a new `TeachingClass` object with ID and name set to `CS2113T-F12`
and `Tutorial Group F12` respectively.
* Step 4 - Then, `ClassList.addClass` is called to add the newly created `TeachingClass` object into the `classes` ArrayList
within `ClassList`.

<br>

### Add Student
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_student` command works:
![AddStudentSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add student feature behaves at each step:<br>
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_student c/CS2113T i/a0217978j n/jonny` to add a student. The `add_student` command 
calls the `AddStudentCommand.execute` method. Within `AddStudentCommand.execute`, `ModuleList.getModule("CS2113T")` is 
called to ensure that there is an existing module with code `CS2113T`.
* Step 2 - If an existing module with code `CS2113T` is found, a new `Student` object with id and name set to 
`a0217978j` and `jonny` respectively. Then, `StudentList.addModule` is called to add the newly created `Student` 
object into the `students` ArrayList within `StudentList`.

<br>

### Add Assessment
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `add_assessment` command works:
![AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/AddAssessmentSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the add assessment feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `add_assessment c/cs2113t n/midterms m/20 w/10` to add an assessment. The `add_assessment`
  command calls the `AddAssessmentCommand.execute` method. Within `AddAssessmentCommand.execute`,
  `ModuleList.getModuleWithCode("cs2113t")` is called to ensure that there is an existing module with code `cs2113t`.
* Step 2 - If an existing module with code `cs2113t` is found, the `MAXIMUM_MARKS` and `WEIGHTAGE` arguments are checked
  to ensure that they are valid.
* Step 3 - If the `MAXIMUM_MARKS` and `WEIGHTAGE` arguments are valid, a new `Assessment` object with name,
  maximum marks and weightage set to `midterms`, `20` and `10` respectively is created under the existing `Module` with
  code `cs2113t`. Then, `AssessmentList.addAssessment` is called to add the newly created `Assessment` object into the
  `assessments` ArrayList within `AssessmentList`.
* Step 4 - Within `AssessmentList.addAssessment`, the name of the newly created `Assessment` object is checked to ensure
  there is no existing assessment with name `midterms`. At the same time, the weightage of the newly created
  `Assessment` object is also checked to ensure that the total weightage of the assessments in the `cs2113t` module
  will not exceed 100 with the addition of the weightage of the newly created `Assessment` object.
* Step 5 - If the name and weightage of the newly created `Assessment` object are valid, the newly created `Assessment`
  object is added into the `assessments` ArrayList within `AssessmentList`.

<br>

### Set Marks
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `set_mark` command works:
![SetMarkSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/SetMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

Steps:
1. The `Taa` instance reads in a user input through the `Ui.getUserInput()` method.
2. The user input is then parsed using the `Parser.parseUserInput(userInput:String)` static method and a `Command` object
   is returned.
3. `AddModuleCommand.checkArguments()` is then called to check if the arguments are valid.
4. After checking the arguments, `Command.execute(moduleList:ModuleList, ui:Ui, storage:Storage)` will be called.
5. The `module:Module` which the student and assessment belongs to is retrieved with 
`getModuleWithCode(moduleCode:String)`.
6. Using `module:Module`, we are able to get the `studentList:StudentList` and `assessmentList:AssessmentList`.
7. The `student:Student` and `assessment:Assessment` are then retrieved from their lists using 
`getStudentAt(studentIndex:Integer)` and `getAssessment(assessmentName:String)` respectively.
8. Finally, `setMarks(assessmentName:String, marks:Double)` is called to set the marks of the assessment in the 
student's `results` HashMap.
9. A message will then be printed out to indicate to the user that the marks have been set successfully.

<br>

### Set Attendance
The sequence diagram shown below illustrates how the `set_attendance` command works:
![SetAttendanceSequenceDiagram](diagrams/sequence/SetAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

Below is an example scenario of how the set attendance feature behaves at each step:
* Step 1 - The user executes `set_attendance c/CS2113T s/1 l/1 p/1` to set an attendance to `Present` for student at 
index `1`, lesson number `1` to set a student's attendance for a lesson. The `set_attendance` command calls the 
`SetAttendanceCommand.execute` method. Within `SetAttendanceCommand.execute`, `AttendanceList.getAttendance("1")` is 
called to ensure that there is no existing attendance with the
lesson number `1`for student at index `1`.
* Step 2 - If no existing attendance object with lesson number `1` for student at index `1` is found, a new 
`Attendance` object
with lesson number `1` and attendance record `Present` is set as its lesson number and attendance record respectively.
Then, `AttendanceList.addAttendance` is called to add the newly created `Attendance` object into the `attendances` 
ArrayList within `AttendanceList`.
