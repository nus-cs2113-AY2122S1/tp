## 1. Introduction
**SchedUrMods** is a desktop application for NUS students who wish to manage 
their assignments and semester-related information via CLI (command-line interface).
If you can type fast, SchedUrMods can help you manage your daily tasks faster 
as compared to a traditional GUI application.

**SchedUrMods** is written in `Java 11` and utilises the **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** 
paradigm to provide the following benefits during the development of the application. 

- Modularity for easier troubleshooting
- Reuse of code through inheritance 
- Flexibility through polymorphism

### 1.1 Purpose
This developer guide is intended for software developers, designers, or testers who wish
to contribute to the development of the **SchedUrMods** application. 

The guide provides an overall architectural view of **SchedUrMods** and describes the 
implementation of key features of the application that is supplemented with easy to understand
UML diagrams.

## 3. Design
### 3.1 Architecture
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AmosUMLDiagrams/Architecture.png">
</p>

The Architecture Diagram above shows the high-level design of **SchedUrMods** 
and how **SchedUrMods** main components are connected.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/SchedUrMods_Architecture.png">
</p>

The Diagram above shows the class associations on a more granular level.

**Main components of the architecture**

`SchedUrMods` contains the main method of the application. It is responsible for,
- **At app launch**: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- **While app is running**: Reads user input and outputs the appropriate command result.
- **At shut down**: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The rest of the App consists of seven main components.
- `UI`: Handles user input and displaying of messages on the terminal.
- `Parser`: Interpret user input and decides which `Command` is to be executed.
- `Command`: Collection of user command classes + Handles command execution
- `Storage`: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.
- `Utility`: Collection of classes used by multiple other components.
- `Logger`: Handles the logging throughout all classes
- `NUSMods API`: Communicate with NUSMods server to pull module related information.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The **Sequence Diagram** below shows how the components interact with each other for the 
scenario where the **user inputs any valid command** in to the application.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AmosUMLDiagrams/SD_ValidInput.png">
</p>

### 3.2 UI Component
The **main API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AmosUMLDiagrams/CD_UIComponent.png">
</p>

The UI Component consists of the `Ui.java` class, which handles all user input and output operations within the 
**SchedUrMods** application. The application structure (i.e. logo, borders, cursor...) is also defined in this 
class as constant `String` variables to improve readability of the class and allow changes to be made
to the general user interface easier.

The `Ui.java` class implements the below functionalities using the following methods:
- `printLogo`: Prints the application logo when the application is launched.
- `printCursor`: Prints the user's cursor to indicate point of entering commands.
- `readInput`: Obtain user input entered as a `String` to be parsed later on.
- `printMessage`: Prints the system generated messages (i.e. command execution, errors, exceptions...)
in a pre-defined formatting.

### 3.3 Parser Component
The **main API** of this component is specified in [`CommandParser.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/duke/parser/CommandParser.java)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AmosUMLDiagrams/CD_ParserComponent.png">
</p>

The Parser Component consists of `CommandParser.java` and other additional helper parsers such as `DateParser.java`, 
`TaskParser.java`, and `TaskUsageParser.java` classes. Importantly, the `CommandParser.java` class is responsible 
for parsing the user's input and generating the correct `Command` object to be returned to the `SchedUrMods` class.

Any flags and arguments present in the user's input are extracted out and stored in a `Map<String, String>` as a 
flag to argument keyset. This `Map` is then parsed as a parameter during the creation of the `Command` object along
with the **main command** converted into a `CommandEnum`.

The `CommandParser.java` class implements the below functionalities using the following methods:
- `getCommandOptions`: Converts the command arguments entered by the user into a `Map<String, String>` variable. 
The purpose of this is to enable direct and easier access to flags based on the name.
- `createCommand`: Creates the correct `Command` based on the main command and any flags or arguments it may have.
- `parseCommand`: Parent method that calls the above methods after splitting and sanitising the user's input into
a `CommandEnum` variable for the **main command** and a `Map<String, String>` variable for the flags or arguments 
associated with it.

### 3.4 Command Component
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/Command_Class_Diagram.png" width="850">
</p>

The `Command` component consists of an abstract class `Command` that all commands should inherit from. There are then 3 seperate types of Commands.
 - `XYZCommand`: These are commands that do not interact with `TaskManager` and need no flags. e.g. the 'bye' command.
 - `XYZTaskManagerCommand`: These are commands that perform a function with `TaskManager` based on the flags that are entered in the `Map<String, String>` e.g. the 'edit' or 'sort' command.
 - `TaskCommand` these are commands that add Tasks to the `TaskManager`. individual TaskCommands will inherit from this class and set the `TaskFactory` and Task usage e.g. the 'Deadline' command.
   >💡 **Note**: The `ModuleCommand` is implemented with `XYZTaskManagerCommand` instead of `TaskCommand` as it does **not** use a `TaskFactory`.  

On executing the command (`executeCommand()` called), the `CommandResult` should be returned with 2 variables. `message` is the message to be printed back to the user and `isExited` is whether the program should exit after this command.

### 3.5 TaskManager Component
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/TaskManager_Object_Diagram.png" width="850">
</p>

The `TaskManager` component is what manages all the Tasks in the program.  
In `TaskManager`, there are 2 lists. `taskList` and `latestFilteredList`.
- `taskList`: corresponds to the list of all tasks currently stored in the `TaskManager`.
- `latestFilteredList`: corresponds to the latest list that was printed by the `list` command.
   - This list was created to make it easier for users to delete and edit tasks as they can use the index in `latestFilteredList`. E.g. if they wanted to delete all `low` priority tasks, they can list with a filter of `low` priority and delete all those tasks.

When listing tasks. `refreshDate()` is called before listing tasks. This is to enure that all dates are recurred to the latest date if they have a `recurrence` that is not `none`.
The `Task` object is what is managed by the `TaskManager`. 
 - Each Task has a `description`, `priority` and `recurrence` with concrete Tasks adding any additional variables and formatting the `getTaskEntryDescription()` method respectively.
   >💡 **Note**: Fixed values such as `priority` and `recurrence` are stored as an enum to ensure standardisation and that there are no invalid values being stored.
 - They also each have their own `TaskFlag` class which includes a list of all valid flags for agruments in creating the specific task.
   - This is used in the '`checkAllEditFlagsValid()` in the `edit` command function in editing tasks to ensure that all the flags entered by the user are correct for the respective task.  
 - `taskEdit()` is to be overridden to check the `Map<String, String>` for the respective flags in the concrete `Taskflag` and edit the parameters in the concrete `Task` object respectively.

### 3.6 Storage Component
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/Storage_Sequence_Diagram1.png">
</p>

The Storage is handled by the `DataManager` class.
 - All of the objects are initialised on starting the program in `SchedUrMods` class.
 - The `DataManager` class takes in a `FileCreator` which creates the file for storing the Task data.
 - The `TaskManager` class takes in a `DataManager` and loads the `taskList` using the DataManager. It also adds the `DataManager` as an `Observer` so that it can update the `DataManager` whenever `taskList` changes.
 - The `DataManager` has been designed with **Dependency injection** in mind so that programmers would know what objects are required for each class.
   >💡 **Note**: `TaskManager` can be initialised without any `DataManager` as an argument. In which case it would still work albeit without any storage functionality. (useful for testing)

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/Storage_Sequence_Diagram2.png">
</p>

 - Whenever a Create, Read or Update function is performed in TaskManager on `taskList`, the `updateObservers()` function should be called so that `DataManager` can write the updated `taskList` to the Task save file.
 - Because `taskList` is created in `DataManager` and returned to `TaskManager` (as seen in the first sequence diagram), there is no need to constantly pass the `taskList` as an argument to `DataManager` when calling `update()` as they **both** have the same reference to `taskList`.
 - The Tasks are stored in a `json` format in the file `data/tasks.dat` and are parsed using the [`Gson`](https://github.com/google/gson) library.

>💡 **Note**: The storage component has been implemented using the [Observer Design Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) where `TaskManager` implements `Subject` and `DataManager` implements `Observer`.

### 3.7 Logger Component
 - The Logger has been implemented with the `java.util.logging` library.
 - It's designed to be as easy to use as possible where in order to log any message, you only have to use `Log.<severity>(message)`.
   - E.g. `Log.info("this is an info log")`.
 - The logger will automatically log your message in the following format:
```
[YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss] [full.class.path]
SEVERITY: Log Message Here 
```
- The way the logger gets the class name is by using the `Thread.currentThread().getStackTrace()` function to determine which class called the log function.
- All individual class loggers are stored in a hashmap `Map<String, Logger>` where if a class name is not already in the hashmap on calling any log function, it will be added automatically.
- All log messages above `Level.SEVERE` will be printed to console and all log messages above `Level.FINE` will be added to the log file `log.txt`.

### 3.8 NUSMods API Component

The major parts of this component lies within the nusmods package.

The parsing logic is implemented in the NusModsParser class, which exposes the following public API,

![NusModsParser class diagram](images/JialunUMLDiagrams/CD_NusModsParser.png)

- `getLessons`: Obtain an array of Lesson objects given a module code and a lesson number. 
This relies on either local cache or network being available.

Additionally, the auxiliary class `Semester` implements complement utility for handling NUS semesters and offers two-way
conversion between java time API and semesters. The enumeration class `Semester` exposes the following APIs,

![Semester class diagram](images/JialunUMLDiagrams/CD_Semester.png)

- `getSemester`: Get the semester at a certain time, or at the current instant.
- `fromInt`: Convert the integer representation from NUSMods API response to the enumeration.
- `getWeekLength`: Get the number of weeks in a certain semester.
- `acadWeeksToRealWeeks`: Convert academic weeks to real weeks.
- `getStartingMonday`: Get the starting Monday of a specific semester, or the current semester.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Task Factories
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/TaskFactory_Sequence_Diagram.png">
</p>

`Todo`, `Deadline` and `Event` Tasks are created using their respective Task factories.
 - All Task factories inherit from the abstract `TaskFactory` class and are created using similar steps:
   1. It firstly checks that all the required flags for making the concrete Task are present and throws `RequiredArgmentNotProvidedException` if a flag is missing.
   2. It then initialises the `description`, `priority` and `recurrence`. 
   3. From there it sets any additional variables that are present in the concrete Task.
   4. It creates the task and sets the `priority` and `recurrence` if they are not `null`
   5. It returns the created concrete Task.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/SeanUMLDiagrams/TaskFactory_Object_Diagram.png">
</p>

The `TaskFactory` has been designed using the [Factory Method Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern#UML_class_diagram). It was also designed to be easily extendable to allow for more concrete Task factories to be easily added. Each set of variables are initialised in their respective factories. e.g. `priority` is a `Task` variable so it's initialised and set in `TaskFactory` while `dueDate` is a `Deadline` variable so it's initialised and set in `DeadlineFactory`.

1. To extend the `TaskFactory`, you should create a constructor which takes in a `Map<String, String> flags` argument and define `TypeEnum taskType` and `String[] requiredFlags` as constants.
2. From there you have to override the `setAdditionalVariables()` function to set any new variables that are unique to the concrete Task you want to impelment.
3. override `createTask()` to return the constructed Task (you can ignore `priority` and `recurrence` as they are set in `TaskFactory`)
4. optional: you may override `getTask()` to return the concrete Task instead of the abstract `Task`.

### 4.2 Filtering the tasklist

The sequence diagram and description below shows the process of filtering the user's tasklist that is managed
by the `TaskManager.java` class.

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/AmosUMLDiagrams/SD_FilteringTasklist.png">
</p>

**Step 1**: When the `ListCommand` receives the call to be executed by the main class `SchedUrMods`, it will proceed to call the `listTasklistWithFilter()` method 
and input the command arguments stored as a flag-argument `Map<String, String>`, in this case the **filters** entered by the user, 
that was previously sanitised by the `CommandParser`.

**Step 2**: The `listTasklistWithFilter()` method will then loop through all the **filters** and check the validity of the filters
currently stored in the flag-argument `Map<String, String>`.

**Step 3**: For each valid filter found, the respective filter functions will be called and will filter out all the tasks that
do not match the filter specified by the user. For instance, if the filter flag equals to `type` and it's corresponding mapped
value is `Todo`, then the method `filterListByTaskType()` will filter out all the tasks who do not have task type equals to `Todo`,
and return a filtered tasklist with only `Todo` tasks.

**Step 4**: The returned filtered tasklist will be reused for the remaining filters present in the flag-argument `Map<String, String>`
of the filters to allow for multi-level filter to increase the filtering depth for the user to locate specific tasks
that matches multiple filters.

**Step 5**: Once the `listTasklistWithFilter()` method has looped through all the filters stored in the `Map<String, String>`,
it will call the `getListTasklistWithFilterMessage()` method along with the final filtered tasklist to obtain a nicely 
pre-formatted `String` containing a neat list of the final filtered tasks that matched all the filtering criteria.

**Step 6**: A `CommandResult` object is then created and stores the `String` containing the filtered tasklist
as the command execution message to be handled by the `Ui` and displayed to the user on the terminal interface.

### 4.2.1 Time proximity based filtering

All tasks are first gotten and converted into a stream for layer mutilation. Then, the time is first found for each task using the unified interface `Task::getHappenTime`, to filter out tasks that does not have an associated time. Subsequently, the next occurrence is obtained with,
- `Lesson::getNextOccurrence` if the task is a lesson, since lessons have irregular recurrences, or,
- `RecurrenceEnum::getNextRecurredDate` otherwise.

If the time of the next occurrence falls within the threshold time length from now, the task is preserved.

Finally, the stream is sorted by the occurrence time and collected into a string for return.

### 4.3 [Proposed] Refactor `TaskManager`
The team has thought of refactoring `TaskManager` because as of currently, it does not seem to be following the 'Single Responsibility Principle'. Because `TaskManager` both manages the `taskList` and `latestFilteredList`, it seems that it is having 2 responsibilities. The team believes that this issue can be fixed using either the 'Facade', 'Decorator' or 'Proxy' design pattern. However, due to lack of time, we have bundled the two Task lists into one class.

### 4.4 [Proposed] Reminder component
SchedUrMods have pop-up reminders for all tasks with a time constraint, and all information about the pop-up reminder is stored in `Reminder` objects and controlled by `ReminderManager` class.

#### 4.4.1 `Reminder` Class

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/XuefeiUMLDiagrams/ReminderUML.JPG" width="500">
</p>

The `Reminder` objects are implemented in all `Task` objects, however, `reminder` is only initialized in the `Task` objects with time constraint such as todo with a doOn time.

- `taskTime` stores the time of a task should be done or start in the case of event and lesson.
- `ReminderTime` stores the time that the reminder for the corresponding task should be triggered.
- `userMinute` `userDay` `message` record the minutes and days a reminder should be shown prior to task time and the message to be shown for each reminder.
  - `userMinute` is 10 by default and `userDay` is 0 by default.    
  - These three fields can be customized by users and the customization would be handled by `ReminderManager`.
- `BUFFER_SECOND` is set to 30, so as long as system time falls in a one-minute duration 30 seconds before and after the exact reminder time, the reminder would pop-up. The buffer time is used to avoid missing the time to send the reminder when running any other command 
- `reminderDone` indicates if a reminder message has been sent or not to avoid sending multiple reminders within the buffer period, it is set to false by default.

#### 4.4.2 `ReminderManager` Class
<p align="center">
    <img src="images/XuefeiUMLDiagrams/ReminderManagerUML.JPG" width="600">
</p>

The `ReminderManage` object handles customization of reminder time and message and checking the whole task list to display reminder message.
- The `customizeReminder(TaskManager, Map<String, String>)`  method is called when reminder command executes, the method checks for fields input by the user and call respective method to change minute, day or message for the reminder of corresponding task with the index input by the user.
- The method `printReminder(TaskManager)` is called at the start of every iteration by the main class when the program is running. It calls `sendReminder(TaskManager)` to check if there is any reminder to be sent at the time instance, and output the reminder if there is a need.
- `sendReminder` class check through all the tasks in the task list to see if there is a need for sending a reminder at the time when it is called.

### Saving files

As of currently, it is out of scope for our program to handle corrupted data files. As such, we have put a disclaimer in the user guide that the team is not responsible for any loss of data or undefined behaviour if users directly modify the task save file.

**Case A**: No permission to write to task save file
1. Modify `date\tasks.dat` to read only
2. Try to create a Task e.g. Type `Todo blah`
   **Expected Output**:
```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[user]: todo blah
|| Task created!
[2021-11-08 06:04:47] [seedu.tp.storage.DataManager]
SEVERE: No permission to write to save file. Ensure the program has write access to C:\Users\seand\Documents\tp\data\tasks.dat
and restart the program to allow created tasks to be saved! 
|| [T] blah <medium> {none} (doOn: 08-11-2021 07:00)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
```
The todo will be shown in the task list but will not be reflected in the data folder.

**Case B**: File exists with save folder name
On program run:
   **Expected Output**:
```
[2021-11-08 06:03:21] [seedu.tp.storage.FileCreator]
SEVERE: File 'data' already exists in project folder. Please remove it and restart the application to be able to save tasks!
```
