### <a name="sys-arch"></a>System Architecture

![](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The above **System Architecture** diagram shows the high-level design of Mint.

On launch, the `Main` class initialises the app components in the correct sequence and links them up with each other, in
the correct sequence.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Apart from `Main`, Mint comprises six main components, namely:

- `Ui`: The UI of the App
- `Logic`: Make sense of user input and execute command
- `Model`: Holds the data of the App and performs actions on the data.
- `Storage`: Reads from and writes to [`LocalStorage`](#local-storage).

The four components interact with each other.

### <a name="text-ui"></a>Ui Component

![](images/Ui.png)

The UI consists of a `Ui` class that represents the interface that the user interacts with.

The Ui component,

* takes in user inputs.
* pass them either to the `Logic` component or `Storage` component.
* outputs entries requested by the user.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions of `Ui` component with the `Logic` component and the user for the `view` command. For detailed implementation of `Logic` class, refer to [Logic](#logic) section.

![](images/UiSequenceDiagram.png)

> As the `execute` method of `Duke` class takes in 7 arguments but only some are used in this
> command's case, unused arguments are represented as `..` to focus on the used arguments.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <a name="logic"></a>Logic Component

Here is a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component.

![](images/Logic.png)

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to parse a command, it uses `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. The `Parser` prepares to return a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its 
   subclasses e.g.,`AddCommand`) by parsing the arguments.
3. `Parser` encapsulates the details of the query as an `Entry` object from `Model`.
4. `Parser` returns a `Command` object, which is executed by `Main`.
5. The `Command` can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed 
6. The `Command` saves the resulting data by using the `Storage`.
7. The result is printed to the user by the `Ui`.
   (e.g. to add a recurring entry)

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the 
`parseCommand("add n/movie a/12")` API call. For detailed implementation of `Parser` class, refer to [Implementation](#implementation) section.

![](images/CaptureLogicSequence.PNG)

> As the `execute` method of `Duke` class takes in 7 arguments but only some are used in this
> command's case, unused arguments are represented as `...` to focus on the used arguments. Same reason for `checkExceedBudget` applies.
> This also applies for the sequence diagrams in the following sections.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <a name="model"></a>Model Component

The `Model` package consists of three sub-components: `FinanceManager`, `Entry`, and `Budget`.

##### <a name="finance"></a>FinanceManager and Entry Components

![](images/Finance.png)

The `FinanceManager` component,

- stores all the entry data i.e., all `Entry` objects.
    - `NormalFinanceManager` object stores all the `Income` and `Expense` objects
    - `RecurringFinanceManager` stores all the `RecurringIncome` and `RecurringExpense` objects
- performs action on the list of `Entry` objects (e.g., add, delete, etc.)
- depends on the `Ui` component as some action needs confirmation from the user (e.g. For edit, after the user chooses
  the entry to edit, the user needs to provide the fields to be edited.)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Entry` component,

- stores information about the individual `Entry` object.
- does not depend on any of the other three components.

#### <a name="budget"></a>Budget Component

![](images/Budget.png)

The `Budget` package consists of a `BudgetManager` and the `Budget`'s each of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.

- `Budget` is an abstract class
- `XYZBudget`(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specified budget e.g., `FoodBudget`), inherits `Budget` and its attributes.
- `BudgetManager` stores a list of the seven `ExpenseCategory`'s.
- Currently, `BudgetManager` only interacts in 2 ways
    - when user want to set budget for a specific category
    - when other parts of the app requires the list of budgets e.g., `Ui` needs the list to print to the user, or
      `FinanceManager` needs to know if the user is nearing their spending limit to notify them.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <a name="storage"></a>Storage Component

**How the `Storage` component works:**

**1. Loading the lists from the stored files:**

![](images/StorageLoadFiles.png)
> For ease of visualization, since the logic for all the different lists are the same, we have broken it down to show
> one example using the diagram

1. When the program is executed, all the objects including the `BudgetDataManager`, `DataManagerActions`,
   `NormalListDataManager` and `RecurringListDataManager` would be created.
2. The programme would then load all the stored content from the lists which records the user's previously recorded
   normal expenditure, recurring expenditure, and the spending limits they set for each category.
3. Upon detection, missing text files, and the required directory would be created.

**2. General logic for each command:**

![](images/Storage.png)

1. After the command is extracted from the `Parser`, `Duke` would call the respective command class. In the case of the
   add function, the `AddCommand` class would be called.
2. In the `AddCommand` class, after the add command has been successfully performed, a method call to
   `appendToEntryListTextFile` would activate the `NormalListDataManager` class for which the added entry would be
   appended to an external text file.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**The `Storage` component:**

1. Can save all the `recurringEntryList`, `budgetList` and the `entryList` in a text file. It is also able to read the
   data from the respective text files and read them back into the corresponding objects.
2. Has four different classes. `DataManagerActions` comprises the common components used by the other two classes,
   `BudgetListDataManager`, `RecurringListDataManager` and `NormalListDataManager`. All of these classes inherit from
   the `DataManagerActions` class.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## <a name="implementation"></a>Implementation

### Parser

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the detailed interactions within the `Logic` component, focusing on `Parser` class,
for the `parseCommand("add n/movie a/12")` API call.

![](images/CaptureParserSequence.PNG)

When `parseCommand("add n/movie a/12")` is called,

1. The `Parser` prepares to return a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its
   subclasses e.g.,`AddCommand`) by parsing the arguments.
2. Parsed fields (e.g., `name`, `amount`) are checked if they are valid through `ValidityChecker` class's static methods.
3. If the parsed `type` is `Type.Income`, it creates an `Income` object based on the parsed fields.
4. Else, which means the parsed `type` is `Type.Expense`, it creates an `Expense` object based on the parsed fields.
>If the command is related to `RecurringEntry` (e.g.,`AddRecurringCommand`), `RecurringIncome` object is created for `Type.Income`,
> and `RecurringExpense` object is created for `Type.Expense`.
5. The `Command` object is created, and returned to the `Duke` class.

### BudgetManager

Below is a sequence diagram of how the `BudgetManager` interacts with other classes to check if user exceeds their
budget.

![](images/BudgetWarning.png)

Note: `XYZBudget` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specified budget e.g., `FoodBudget`)

When `checkExceedBudget(entry,...)` is called, assuming `entry` is of type `Expense`,

1) `BudgetManager` will fetch both `Entries` and `RecurringEntries` from their respective `FinanceManager`.
    - For readability purposes, we will denote all entries as `entries` and group both `NormalFinanceManager`
      and `RecurringFinanceManager` as `FinanceManager`.

2) `BudgetManager` will then retrieve the specific `XYZBudget` corresponding to `entry`'s category.

- `BudgetManager` now have reference to the specific `XYZBudget`.

3) Using the same instance of `XYZBudget`, `BudgetManager` will
    1) get monthly spending corresponding to the `entry`'s category.
    2) get limit/budget set for `XYZBudget`, which is of `entry`'s category.

4) Lastly, `BudgetManager` will check if user has exceeded their threshold for that specific category and prints a
   warning message to the user if they have done so.

#### Design considerations

Aspect: how to check whether user exceeded budget

- Option 1 (current choice): iterate through the list of entries each time `checkExceedBudget(entry,...)` is called and
  return the `amountSpent` and `spendingLimit` corresponding to the current `Entry`'s category. Only happens when
  user `add` entries.
    - Pros: Easy to implement. Less coupling of components.
    - Cons: More LOC and slower runtime.

- Option 2: instantly updates the budget's monthly spending when user `add`, `delete` or `edit` (recurring)
  entries.
    - Pros: Faster runtime and more responsive warning messages (such as when user `edit` the `Entry` to an overspent
      budget.)
    - Cons: massive coupling of components.

We picked option 1 as it was in line with our goal of making our code OOP with separate components. Initially, we
pursued option 2 and found it hard to add functionalities and do unit testing due to the coupling available. Option 2
also meant to make the live updating work, we had to deal with 7 commands: `add`, `addR`, `delete`, `deleteR`
, `deleteAll`, `edit` and `editR`. Hence, we went with Option 1 due to scalability.

### <a name="delete"></a>Deleting an `Entry`

1. **Prerequisites**: List all entries using the `view` command. Multiple entries in the list.

2. **Test case**: `delete n/Movie c/1` 

    Expected:
   - If there is one `Entry` that matches the query, it asks user if the user wants to delete the found Entry.
     - Input `y`, then it would delete the `Entry` and tell that it is deleted.
     
    ```
    delete n/Movie c/1
    Is this what you want to delete?
        Expense  | ENTERTAINMENT | 2021-11-03 | Movie | $20.00
    Type "y" if yes. Type "n" if not.

    ```
   
     <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

    - If there are multiple entries that match the query, it asks the user to choose the index of Entry that the
   user wants to delete from a given list. 
     - Enter `2`, then it would delete the second `Entry` shown and tell that it is deleted.
    
    ```
   delete n/movie c/1
   Here is the list of items containing the keyword.

    ```
    delete d/2021-11-04
    Is this what you want to delete?
       Expense  | TRANSPORTATION | 2021-11-04 | Taxi | $6.99
    Type "y" if yes. Type "n" if not.
    n
    Ok. I have cancelled the process.
    ```
   
   - If there are multiple entries that match the query, it asks the user to choose the index of Entry that the
     user wants to delete from a given list.
     - Input `cancel`, then it exits the delete process.
    
    ```
    delete d/2021-11-04

2. **Test case**: `edit a/20 d/2021-12-03 n/Movie c/1`
    
    Expected:
    - If there is one `Entry` that matches the query, it asks user if the user wants to edit the found `Entry`.
        - Input `y`, then it would prompt the user to input the fields to update.
        - The user can then key in the fields to update, and it would update the `Entry` accordingly.
