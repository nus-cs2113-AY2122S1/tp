## [1. Introduction](#content)

CardLI is a Command Line Interface (CLI) desktop app that helps students manage their flashcards. It also allows
students to test and review their knowledge. All of this in one single platform.

## [3. Design](#content)

CardLi has one main component, ```Main```, consisting of one class `CardLi`. It is responsible for:

<li> At app launch: initializing the components in the correct sequence, and connecting them up with each other</li>

![](assets/dg diagrams/overallArchitectureDiagram.png)

The rest of the App consists of the following components:

* ```Model```: Holds the data of the App in memory.
* ```UI```: The UI of the App
* ```Logic```: The command executor
* ```Storage```: Reads and writes data from and to external files

Each component is explained in the sections below.

### [3.1. Model Component](#content)

![](assets/dg diagrams/modelArchitectureDiagram2.png)

The `Model` component consists of two packages, `flashcard` and `testing`.

The `flashcard` package contains:
<li> DeckManager</li>
<li> Deck </li>
<li> FlashCard</li>
<br>

The `testing` package contains:
<li> Answer</li>
<li> TestManager</li>
<li> TestHistory</li>
<li> TestManager</li>
<li> Countdown</li>

A `Deck` contains a private ArrayList of `FlashCards`, and `DeckManager` contains a private ArrayList of `Decks`.

An `AnswerList` contains a private ArrayList of `Answers`, which is created by `TestManager` when the commands for the
test functions are executed (`ReviewCommand`, `TestCommand`).

The `Countdown` class creates a timer that displays the time left for a question during a Test or Review.

### [3.2. UI Component](#content)

The UI component consists of two classes, ```CardLiUi``` and ```TestUi```.

` CardLiUi` outputs greeting messages, exit messages, help messages and command results to the user on command. It takes
in input from the user when the program is not in Test or Review.

`TestUi` handles the input and output for the Test and Review functions. More details are explained in the
implementation section for Test.

### [3.3. Logic Component](#content)

![](assets/dg diagrams/logicArchitectureDiagram.png)

> ℹ️  `XYZCommand` is a placeholder name for subclasses of the abstract `Command` class (e.g. `AddCardsCommand`, `DeleteDeckCommand`, `TestCommand`, etc.)

The above diagram is a partial architecture diagram of the `Logic` component. It executes user commands via Command
classes with the appropriate arguments as given by the Parser classes.

CardLi’s user commands operate on a 2-tier structure: a Systemwide level and a Deck level. The Systemwide level commands
execute commands related to the management of decks, testing and reviewing, while the Deck level commands execute
commands related to flashcards in a specific deck. The specific implementations are elaborated on in the *
Implementation* section.

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Main` is called upon to execute a command, `Inner Parser` or `Outer Parser` parses the user input to get the
   command word.
2. According to the command word, a subclass of the `Command` object (e.g. `AddCardsCommand`, `DeleteDeckCommand`, etc.)
   is created.
3. The command communicates with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a flashcard).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned to the `UI`
   from `Logic` to be processed.

![](assets/dg diagrams/parserArchitectureDiagram.png)

The architecture diagram above contains the parser classes in `Logic` that are used for parsing a user command.

How the parsing works:

`Inner Parser` or `Outer Parser` creates a `XYZCommand` which in turn creates its corresponding `XYZCommandParser`
(e.g. when `InnerParser` creates a `EditCardCommand`, `EditCardCommand` creates a `EditCardParser`.)

All `XYZCommandParser` classes implement the `CommandArgumentParser` interface.

### [3.4. Storage Component](#content)

The `Storage` component:

* Saves all the decks
* Saves all the flashcards
* Saves all the flashcard scores
* Remembers which deck each flashcard belongs to
* Saves the results of each test

All app data is saved as JSON files.

### [4.1. Edit](#content)

This subsection provides details on the implementation of the commands that enable the editing of the `Deck`
and `FlashCard` objects.

#### [4.1.1. `EditDeckCommand`](#content)

Given below is the sequence diagram for `edit` (Deck):

![](assets/dg diagrams/EditDeckCommandSeqDiagram2.png)

The `EditDeckCommand` allows the changing of the name of the `Deck`. The user can only edit the `name` attribute of the
`Deck` object, which represents the name of the deck.

By entering the `edit` command in the `OuterParser` class, an `EditDeckCommand` object is created and its constructor is
called. This object is returned to `CardLi` class, which then calls the `execute()` method of the `EditDeckCommand`
object.

The `execute()` method in the `EditDeckCommand` class self-invokes the `prepareEditDeckCommand()` method, which helps
the handling of edge cases as well as format the method arguments. In turn, `prepareEditDeckCommand()` self-invokes the
`prepareDeckIndex` method, which handles the formatting of the deck index specified by the user. `prepareDeckIndex()`
returns `deck`, of string type, which represents the index of the deck to be edited. `prepareEditDeckCommand()` will
then return a string array, `preparedArguments`, which represents the arguments for the next method call.

The `execute()` method will then call the `editDeck()` method of the `DeckManager` class, which in turn calls the
`setName()` method of the `Deck` class. Once `editDeck()` is completed, a message of string type is returned to the
`execute()` method. The message is stored in a `CommandResult` class, which is then returned to `CardLi`.

`CardLi` then calls upon the `printResult()` method of the `CardLiUi` class to print the message to the user.

#### [4.1.2. `EditCardCommand`](#content)

![](assets/dg diagrams/EditCardCommandSeqDiagram2.png)

The `EditCardCommand` allows the changing of the content of the `FlashCard`. The user can decide to change either
the `front`
or `back` attributes of the `FlashCard`object, which represents the front and back side of the card.

By entering the edit command in the `InnerParser` class, an `EditCardCommand` object is created and its constructor is
called. This object is returned to `CardLi` class, which then calls the `execute()` method of the `EditCardCommand`
object.

The `execute()` method in the `EditCardCommand` class self-invokes the `prepareEditCardCommand()` method, which helps
the handling of edge cases as well as format the method arguments. In turn, `prepareEditCardCommand()` self-invokes the
`prepareCardIndex` method, which handles the formatting of the card index specified by the user. `prepareCardIndex()`
returns the index of the card to be edited as a string. `prepareEditCardCommand()` will then return a string array,
`preparedArguments`, which represents the arguments for the next method call.

The `execute()` method will then call the `editCard()` method of the `Deck` class, which in turn calls the
`setFront()` or `setBack()` method of the `FlashCard` class. Once `editCard()` is completed, a message of string type is
returned to the `execute()` method. The message is stored in a `CommandResult` class, which is then returned to
`CardLi`.

`CardLi` then calls upon the `printResult()` method of the `CardLiUi` class to print the message to the user.

### [4.2. Move](#content)

![](assets/dg diagrams/MoveCommandSeqDiagram2.png)

This subsection provides details on the implementation of the `moveCardCommand`. This command enables moving of a card
in a deck the user is currently in to another deck.

By entering the move command in the `InnerParser` class, an `MoveCardCommand` object is created and its constructor is
called. This object is returned to `CardLi` class, which then calls the `execute()` method of the `MoveCardCommand`
object.

The `execute()` method in the `MoveCardCommand` class self-invokes the `prepareMoveCardCommand()` method, which helps
the handling of edge cases as well as format the method arguments. In turn, `prepareMoveCardCommand()` self-invokes the
`prepareCardIndex` method, which handles the formatting of the card index specified by the user. After this,
`prepareMoveCardCommand()` self invokes the `prepareDeckIndex` method, which handles the formatting of the deck index
specified by the user.`prepareCardIndex()` returns `card`, of string type, which represents the index of the card to be
edited. `prepareDeckIndex()`returns `deck`, of string type, which represents the index of the deck to be edited.
`prepareMoveCommand()` will then return a string array, `preparedArguments`, which represents the arguments for the next
method call.

The `execute()` method will then call the `moveCard()` method of the `DeckManager` class, which in turn calls the
`getCard()` method of the `Deck` class to get a copy of the card to be moved. `DeckManager` then calls the
`addFlashCard()` method of the `Deck` class to add the card to the deck specified by the user. Next, `DeckManager` calls
the `deleteFlashCard()` method of the `Deck` class to delete the card from the deck it was from. Once `moveCard()` is
completed, a message of string type is returned to the `execute()` method. The message is stored in a `CommandResult`
class, which is then returned to `CardLi`.

`CardLi` then calls upon the `printResult()` method of the `CardLiUi` class to print the message to the user.

### [4.3. Find](#content)

![](assets/dg diagrams/findSeqDiagram2.png)

Given above is the sequence diagram of the `find` function. This feature allows users of CardLI to find a
`FlashCard` by providing a search term to the input following the command term `find`. By invoking this function the
user can view specific `FlashCards` matching the search term from the main menu, instead of entering each `Deck` and
manually looking through the list of `FlashCards` for the desired ones.

Currently, `find` is implemented at the Systemwide level. After the `CardLiUi` handles the user input,
`OuterParser` formats the user input and creates a `FindCardsCommand` object which is returned.
`CardLi` calls the `execute()` method of the `FindCardsCommand` object. The `FindCardsParser` extracts the search term(
s) and passes them to `CommandResult` which invokes the  `findCards()`
method of `DeckManager` that repeatedly calls the `returnMatchingFlashCards()` method that iterates once for each
instance of a `Deck`.

`returnMatchingFlashCards()` is implemented by creating a stream that consists of all the `FlashCards` from one deck,
and filters them based on whether they contain the search term given. This method is not case-sensitive. Finally, all
the `FlashCards` that contain the search term are collected in an ArrayList and their console outputs are returned in
string format for `CardLiUi` to display to the user.

### [4.4. Test Feature](#content)

![class diagram](assets/dg diagrams/testClassDiagram.png)

Currently, test feature is implemented at the systemwide level and is handled by `TestManager`.
`TestManager` will call on `TestUi` and `TestParser` to handle the inputs and outputs with the user and the parsing
respectively during the test.

#### [4.4.1. Test Setup](#content)

![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/TestSequenceDiagram.png)

As shown in the sequence diagram above, to enter into test mode, the user needs to enter `test` in the main menu from
which the program will prompt the user to input a number (done in `startTest()`) corresponding to the index of the deck
that they want to be tested on or "all" to test all decks.

![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/getTestDeckSequenceDiagram.png)

In both cases, `TestManager` will create an `AnswerList` using a `Deck` that it creates or gets from
`DeckManager` depending on the condition which is shown by the sequence diagram above. If the user decides to test all
decks, the program will compile all `FlashCards` into a `Deck`. If the user decides to test a single deck, the program
will get that deck instance from `DeckManager`. The `AnswerList` consists of an ArrayList of `Answers` and is where the
user's test responses are stored. The `Deck` to be tested is stored within `AnswerList`.

![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/prepareTestDeckSeqDiagram.png)

After constructing the `AnswerList`, the preparation begins. The `Deck` that is attached to the `AnswerList` gets
duplicated, then shuffled. Afterwards, for each question in the test, an `Answer` is initialised with an empty string
and added to `AnswerList`.

#### [4.4.2. Testing Process](#content)

![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/testInProgressSeqDiagram.png)

This is where the actual test starts. The user is given a total time of 15s x number of questions to answer all the
questions. The test will keep looping until every card in the `Deck` to test is answered, or until the
`Countdown` timer expires. And there is another loop within that loops until the
`currentQuestion`, which is an `int` representing the question number, goes out of bounds, or until the `Countdown`
timer expires. Inside the inner loop, `testCard` is called to test an individual card. The resulting `nextQuestionFlag`
decides whether to proceed to the next question (if it equals to '0') or go back to a previous question
(if it equals to '1'). If this results in `currentQuestion` going out of bounds and if every question is not answered,
currentQuestion will get reset to either the lowest or highest question number that is not answered.

<!--- @@author astralum -->
![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/countdownSeqDiagram.png)
How the `Countdown` class works is shown in the diagram above. When the `Countdown` class is created, it will create a
nested class `CountdownTimerTask` initialised with the `startValue`, or value of time to count down from, and the
`timesUpMessage` that will be printed when the time runs out. Once `Countdown` has been started by calling `start()`,
every second, the time remaining will be printed, then decremented, and the current printed line will be erased and
replaced with the new time remaining. Note, however, that the displaying of the first time remaining will be delayed by
0.1s to allow for the question to be printed first. The loop occurs until the time runs out or `Countdown` has been
stopped by calling `stop()`, which will internally call `cancel()` in `CountdownTimerTask`. If the time runs out,
`CountdownTimerTask` will call the `stop()` method of `Countdown`, which will likewise terminate it.

<!--- @@author xkisxk -->
![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/testCardSeqDiagram.png)

The question is printed for the user to answer. The user's answer is then parsed and checked if it is `/Next` or `/Back`
. If it is neither, the user's answer is added into `AnswerList`. If it is
`/Next`, nextQuestionFlag is set to 0 and if it is `/Back`, nextQuestionFlag is set to 1. If the user has not input an
answer before the countdown timer runs out, the answer for the current question can still be input. However, the answer
stored by the system will be an empty answer and thus will not be counted even if it is correct.

> ! The question will be printed on a new screen. However, if the user scrolls up far enough, the previous inputs can be seen.

![sequence diagram](assets/dg diagrams/markTestSequenceDiagram.png)

After all cards have been tested, the marking process begins as shown by the sequence diagram above. The program prints
the question, followed by the actual answer, followed by the user's answer.

For every correct answer, the `userScore`
and `totalScore` for the `FlashCard` and the `userScore` for the `AnswerList` increments; `TestUi` prints a correct
answer message.

For every wrong answer, the `userScore` for the `FlashCard` and `AnswerList` does not change but the `totalScore` for
the `FlashCard` increments; `TestUi` prints an incorrect answer message.

After all the questions are marked, the user's results are printed and saved in `TestHistory`. This concludes the
entire `startTest()` process.

The `startReview()` process is similar to `startTest()`, except the `getTestDeck()` function has an additional condition
in which only `FlashCards` with `userScore` being strictly less than 50% of `totalScore` are added to the `Deck` to be
reviewed.

<details>
<summary>Remark</summary>

> `TestCommand` and `ReviewCommand` is executed quite differently compared to the other features.
> The other commands return the resulting string of the `execute()` method but ` test` and `review` only return the end
> test/review message.
> This is because, unlike the others, `test` and `review` need to constantly interact with the user,
> which means that the feature needs to print out a response message after the user's input. Furthermore, it needs to
> also update the timer live, which makes storing the entire process as a string
> when `Command.execute()` is called not really feasible.

### [4.5. Storage](#content)

This feature allows users of CardLI to save data on their current `Decks` of `FlashCards` as well as the tests that they
have completed thus far. This will also allow users to re-access the data when they re-enter the application. This way,
they will not have to keep re-adding the same flashcards, while also being able to review tests that they had previously
done on the application.

This feature is implemented by saving the user’s data into two separate JSON files, which is saved into a new `data`
directory created upon first start up of the application if it does not yet exist. This new directory is created within
the current directory from which the `CardLI.jar` file is run in the CLI. The file paths of the two JSON files are hard
coded as `Cards_CardLI.json` and `Tests_CardLI.json`, which will save data on the user's decks of flashcards and test
history respectively. Whenever the user inputs a new command, the application will execute the save functions after the
actions corresponding to the command are completed. This is done in order to maintain data integrity and accuracy in
case of technical malfunctions that may cause the application to terminate prematurely. When the user restarts or
re-enters the application, the application will parse the JSON files and convert them into the relevant data. The format
of how the data is saved into the JSON files are specified during the development process in order to reduce the risk of
bugs arising when they are being parsed, which will be explained in the following paragraphs.

The `Storage` class contains all the methods to execute the save and parse functions to and from the relevant JSON
files. This `Storage` object is created upon first starting up the application to handle all the method calls. The
respective methods will be explained in more detail in the following paragraphs.

#### [4.5.1. Writing to JSON files](#content)

Two separate methods are used for this feature, namely the ` writeCardsToFile()` and the `writeTestsToFile()` methods.
The two methods save the user's `Decks` of `FlashCards` and `TestHistory` to the JSON files respectively. Since the two
methods are effectively similar in their implementation, the sequence diagram below will suffice in depicting their
execution. For all labels that include a "/", the text before the "/" applies for the `writeCardsToFile()` method while
the text after the "/" applies for the
`writeTestsToFile()` method.

![](assets/dg diagrams/writeToFileSeqDiagram.png)

`writeCardsToFile(ArrayList<Deck> decks)`

For the saving of the user's `Decks` of `FlashCards`, the method call will expect an `ArrayList` of `Deck` objects.
The `toJSONObject()` methods within the `Deck`and `FlashCard` classes have been written as per the specified format of
saving the `Decks` of `FlashCards` to the `json` file. Each of the `toJSONObject()` methods returns a formatted JSON
Object containing information about the attributes in each instance of each class, in the form of a map. A combination
of `JSONObject` and `JSONArray` instances are used to format each of the individual attributes, before they are combined
into a single `JSONObject` instance and returned from the method. An example of the format of the `Cards_CardLI.json`
where the `Decks` of `FlashCards` are saved is shown in the image below.

![](assets/Cards_CardLI Example.png)

`writeTestsToFile(ArrayList<AnswerList> testHistory)`

For the saving of the user's test history, the method call will expect an `ArrayList` of `AnswerList` objects.
The `toJSONObject()` methods within the `AnswerList`and `Answer` classes have been written as per the specified format
of saving the `TestHistory` to the `json` file. The concept behind the formatting of the returned JSON Object is the
same as that explained under the `writeCardsToFile()` method. An example of the format of the `Tests_CardLI.json` where
the test data is saved is shown in the screenshot below.

![](assets/Tests_CardLI Example.png)

#### [4.5.2. Reading from JSON files](#content)

The methods for reading from the JSON files are executed once upon each startup of the CardLI application. The methods
use an instance of the `Scanner` class to parse through the JSON files, before using an instance of the
`JSONParser` class to parse through the scanned `String` instances and convert them into the relevant `JSONObject`
instances. As per the saving format explained in the "Writing to JSON files" section above, the methods then reverse
engineer the process to convert and add the user's stored data into the application before any commands are given from
the user. Since the implementation of the two methods, namely
`readCardsFromFile()` and `readTestsFromFile()`, are effectively similar in their implementation, the sequence diagram
below will suffice in depicting their execution. For all labels that include a "/", the text before the "/" applies for
the `readCardsFromFile()` method while the text after the "/" applies for the
`readTestsFromFile()` method. The extension to the "ref" box within the sequence diagram will be shown in a separate
sequence diagram in the following sections.

![](assets/dg diagrams/readFromFileSeqDiagram.png)

##### [4.5.2.1 `readCardsFromFile`](#content)

The `readCardsFromFile()` method reads from the `Cards_CardLI.json` file. As per the sequence diagram under the
"Reading from JSON files" header, this method calls the `parseDeck(JSONObject jsonDeck)` method iteratively to convert
the saved data into individual `Deck` instances to be added into the application. The sequence diagram depicting the
exact implementation and execute of the `parseDeck(JSONObject jsonDeck)` method is shown below.

![](assets/dg diagrams/parseDeckSeqDiagram.png)

##### [4.5.2.2 `readTestFromFile`](#content)

The `readTestsFromFile()` method reads from the `Tests_CardLI.json` file. As per the sequence diagram under the
"Reading from JSON files" header, this method calls the `parseAnswerList(JSONObject jsonTestHistory)` method iteratively
to convert the saved data into individual `AnswerList` instances to be added into the application. The sequence diagram
depicting the exact implementation and execute of the `parseDeck(JSONObject jsonTestHistory)` method is shown below.
