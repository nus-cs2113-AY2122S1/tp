# Developer Guide

## Acknowledgements

In the development of **Accouminate**, [picocli](https://picocli.info) is used. 

**Picocli** is a third-party library for parsing and process the command line.

## Design & implementation

### Architecture


![](img/architecture_overview.png)

The diagram above shows how each component interacts with one another.

The 5 core components of the application are:
- `Ui` - Handles the I/O of the terminal
- `Command` - Provides an interface for various commands, arguments and flags
- `Logic` - Handles the execution of the user commands
- `Storage` - Reads and writes data to the hard disk
- `Model` (or Data Persistence) - Holds the user data in memory

<br />

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The sequence diagram below shows how the core components of Accouminate interact with each other, when the user enters the command `expense add Eat Lunch -v 19.99`.

#### UI component
The Ui component handles all the inputs from the user (i.e. commands) and the outputs from the application.

Currently, the Ui component only composes of a single class - `Ui.java`. The following methods facilitate I/O:
- `getUserInput`: Use a `Scanner` to get a line of user input
- `printErrorMessage`: Prints error, exceptions encountered, prepended with the "Error" header.
- `printSuccessMessage`: Prints a success confirmation message, prepended with the "Success" header.

#### Command component
The Command component is partially delegated to the **picocli** third-party library. The **picocli** library contains an extremely powerful parser and command handler.

The family of the `Command` classes is as follows:
- `MainCommand`: First to invoke when a command is executed. Passes the rest of the command to the appropriate command family. For example, `expense add` will cause this command to be passed to the `ExpenseCommand`.
- `ExitCommand`: A command to handle the case when the user wants to exit the application.
- `ExpenseCommands`: Handles all the expense commands
- `IncomeCommands`: Handles all the income commands
- `BudgetCommands`: Handles all the budget commands.
- `InvestCommands`: Handles all the invest commands.

#### Logic component
The Logic component contains all the `Manager` classes.
1. `BudgetManager.java`
2. `ExpenseManager.java`
3. `IncomeManager.java`
4. `InvestManager.java`

Each `Manager` class handles the logic when adding the respective entities into the data persistence, as well as throwing any exceptions encountered back to the command handler.
Each `Manager` class also implements the interface, `LoadableManager`. This allows the manager to parse user data into the system for use.

Below shows the sequence diagram of how an `Expense` item is added to the `ExpenseList`.

#### Storage component
The Storage component handles the reading and writing of user data onto the hard disk.

![](img/storage_component.png)

- `DataManager` is the facade class to the Storage component, handling requests to write and read user data.
- The `DataReader` and `DataWriter` handles the actual reading and writing of user data to the hard disk.
- `DataIntegrityChecker` checks if the user data exists on the hard disk before the actual file I/O.

#### Model component
The Model component consists of all the entities, as well as the aggregation of the entities as a list.
- Stores the budget data
- Stores the expense data
- Stores the income data
- Stores the investment data, namely stocks and savings

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Reading user data

The read user data feature is implemented by `DataManager`. 

The reading of user data follows these steps:
1. `DataManager` will call `DataIntegrityChecker#check()` to check if the specified directory and the data files for storing user data exists. If the directory or any of the data files does not exist, `DataIntegrityChecker` will create the necessary file or directory.
2. `DataManager` will call `DataReader#read()` to read the contents of each data file.
3. After reading one data file, `DataManager` will pass the data (in string format) to the relevant logic handler for parsing and loading of the models.

Below is the sequence diagram for this feature.

### Writing user data

The write user data feature is implemented by `DataManager`. 

The writing of user data follows these steps:
1. `DataManager` will call `DataIntegrityChecker#check()` to check if the specified directory and the data files for storing user data exists. If the directory or any of the data files does not exist, `DataIntegrityChecker` will create the necessary file or directory.
2. For each logic handler, `DataManager` will call `LoadableManager#parse()`. This will return a parsable string that can be saved in the data file, and can be parsed into models after reading the user data.
3. `DataManager` will then call `DataWriter#write()` to write the data string into each data file.

Below is the sequence diagram for this feature.

## Appendix: Requirements

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
- University students
- Able to type fast
- Comfortable with CLI apps
- Prefer desktop apps to other types (i.e mobile)

### Value proposition

Accouminate helps university students to keep track of their finances to aid them in attaining better financial literacy. It is designed to clearly show the users their budgets, expenses and income to illuminate their paths towards financial literacy.
