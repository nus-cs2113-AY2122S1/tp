## Design & Implementation

### Architecture

The diagram below describes the design of the app and how it functions:

![Architecture Diagram](./RenderedUML/ArchitectureDiagram.svg)

Given below is a quick overview of all the main components of Gordon as well as how these components interact with each other.

#### Main Components

`Main` contains both `main` and `run`.

1. Once the App is launched, `main` will call `run` to initialize the necessary components for the App to function properly
1. On exit, the App will print the corresponding messages and execute the necessary cleanup methods

The App is organized by the `command`, `exception`, `kitchen`, and `util` packages that represent a collection of various different components that are deal with different parts of the functions of the App

1. `command`: Contains all the `XYZ_Command` components that deal with the inputs that the user is able to make.
1. `exception`: Contains all the `GordonException` components that are used throughout the App to handle errors
1. `kitchen`: Contains the `Cookbook` and `Recipe` components that deal with the management of the cookbook database
1. `util`: Contains the `Difficulty`, `Parser`, `Tag` and `UI` components that deal with the functionality of the App

#### How do these components interact with each other

The Sequence Diagram below will show how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `add`:

![Add Sequence Diagram](./RenderedUML/AddSequence.svg)

### Kitchen component

The diagrams below are the class diagrams for the `Cookbook` and `Recipe` Classes in the ``Kitchen`` package:

> `COOKBOOK`
>
> ![Cookbook Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/Kitchen.svg)
> 

> `RECIPE`
>
> ![Recipe Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/Recipe.svg)
> 

The `Cookbook` Class is instantiated by the `Gordon` Class, and manages the recipes and tags of the cookbook.
The `Recipe` Class is instantiated by the `Parser` Class, and contains methods to update an existing recipe.

The `Cookbook` class consists of 2 main attributes

1. The array `recipes` that stores all the main recipes currently in Gordon.
1. The array `cookbookTags` that stores all the tags currently in Gordon.

The `Kitchen` package can be classified into **3** main functionalities:

1. Recipe Management in `Cookbook` :
   * `addRecipe` : Adds recipe to Cookbook
   * `removeRecipe` : Remove recipe from Cookbook
   * `checkRecipe` : Checks whether recipe exists in Cookbook
   * `setIngredients` : Updates the ***ingredients*** of a recipe in the Cookbook
   * `setSteps` : Updates the ***steps*** of a recipe in the Cookbook
   * `setCalories` : Adds ***calories*** to a recipe in the Cookbook
   * `setPrice` : Adds ***price*** to a recipe in the Cookbook
   * `setTime` : Adds ***cooking time*** and ***preparation time*** to a recipe in the Cookbook
   * `setDifficulty` : Adds ***difficulty*** to a recipe in the Cookbook
   * For example, the diagram below shows the sequence diagram when user wants to add ***calories*** to a recipe
     ![AddCalories Sequence Diagram](./RenderedUML/SetCalories.svg)
1. Tag Management in `Cookbook` :
   * `addCookbookTag` : Add a new tag to the ***cookbookTags*** array
   * `deleteCookbookTag` : Deletes a tag from the ***cookbookTags*** array
   * `appendRecipeToCookbookTag` : Associates a recipe with a tag
   * `deleteRecipeToCookBookTag` : Removes a recipe's association with a tag
   * `addTagToRecipes` : Adds a tag to a recipe
   * `deleteTagFromRecipes` : Deletes a tag from a recipe
   * `listCookBookTags` : List all tags in the Cookbook
   * `doesCookBookTagExist` : Check whether a tag exists
   * For example, the diagram below shows the sequence diagram for when user wants to add ***tag*** to a recipe
    ![AddTags Sequence Diagram](./RenderedUML/AddTag.svg)
1. Filter Recipes in `Cookbook` by different traits (such as *ingredients*, *tags*, *calories* etc.): 
   * `filterByIngredients` : Filter by ***ingredients***
   * `filterByTags` : Filter by ***tags***
   * `filterByDifficulty` : Filter by ***difficulty***
   * `filterByPrice` : Filter by ***price***
   * `filterByCalories` : Filter by ***calories***
   * `filterByTime` : Filter by ***cooking time*** and ***preparation time***

### Parser component

The diagram below is the class diagram for the `Parser` class:

![Command Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/Parser.svg)

Functions of the Parser class:

* Reads in user input by implementing the `Scanner` class
  * The `parseMaster()` method parses through the user's input to find the best match for the user's intended command
  * The corresponding command is then returned to the `Gordon` class
  * Below are the methods in the `Parser` class that `parseMaster()` calls:
    * `addRecipeParse`:
      * Adds a new recipe to the Cookbook by instantiating the `AddCommand` class
    * `deleteRecipeParse`:
      * Deletes an existing recipe from the Cookbook by instantiating the `DeleteRecipeCommand` class
    * `deleteTagParse`:
      * Deletes an existing tag from the Cookbook by instantiating the `DeleteTagCommand` class
    * `setParse`:
      * Compares the user's input against a list of valid inputs
      * If valid, this method sets the corresponding attribute of the recipe as intended by the user by instantiating the `SetXYZCommand` class (where XYZ can be Ingredients, Steps, Calories, Difficulty, Price or Time)
    * `findParse`:
      * Compares the user's input against a list of valid inputs
      * If valid, this method finds the corresponding attribute of the recipe as intended by the user by instantiating the `FindXYZCommand` class (where XYZ can be Ingredients, Steps, Calories, Difficulty, Price or Time)
    * `addTagParse`:
      * Adds a new tag to an existing recipe by instantiating the `TagAddCommand` class
    * `unTagParse`
      * Removes an existing tag from its original recipe by instantiating the `TagUntagCommand` class
  * Below are the child classes of the `Command` class that `parseMaster()` instantiates directly:
    * `CheckCommand`
    * `ListRecipesCommand`
    * `HelpCommand`
* Prints responses to the console by implementing the `UI` class

For example, the diagram below shows the sequence diagram for when the user wants to find recipes by their ingredients:
![FindByIngredients Sequence Diagram](./RenderedUML/Find.svg)

### Command component

The Diagram below is the class diagram for the Command Class:

![Command Class Diagram](./RenderedUML/CommandRects.svg)

The `Command` class contains all the basic functionality of the Gordon cookbook, and is the Class that executes specific commands given by the user.

The `Command` class can be classified into 4 main functionalities:

1. Basic Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the basic feature set of the Gordon cookbook are contained here.
   * `AddCommand` is where the `addRecipe` feature is executed.
   * `CheckCommand` is where the `checkRecipe` feature is executed.
   * `DeleteRecipeCommand` is where the `deleteRecipe` feature is executed.
   * `ListRecipesCommand` is where the `listRecipes` feature is executed.
   * `HelpCommand` is where the `help` feature is executed.

   #### Example : `AddCommand`

   `addRecipe Curry Rice /ingredients Curry Sauce + Rice /steps Simmer + Cook rice + Serve`

   #### Expected outcome:

    ```
    Added Curry Rice recipe! Yum!
    Curry Rice
    Ingredients needed: 
    1. Curry Sauce
    2. Rice 
    Method: 
    1. Simmer
    2. Cook
    3. Serve
    ```

2. Set Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the `set` feature of Gordon are contained here.
   * `SetCaloriesCommand` is where the `set` /calories feature of gordon is executed.
   * `SetDifficultyCommand` is where the `set` /difficulty feature of gordon is executed.
   * `SetPriceCommand` is where the `set` /price feature of gordon is executed.
   * `SetIngredientsCommand` is where the `set` /ingredients feature of gordon is executed.
   * `SetStepsCommand` is where the `set` /steps feature of gordon is executed.
   * `SetTimeCommand` is where the `set` /time feature of gordon is executed.

   #### Example : `SetDifficultyCommand`

   `set Curry Rice /difficulty hard`

   #### Expected outcome:

    ```
    Setting difficulty...
    Difficulty set successfully.
    ```

3. Find Commands:
   *The Commands that are required for the `find` feature of Gordon are contained here.
   * `FindTagsCommand` is where the `find` /tags feature of gordon is executed.
   * `FindCaloriesCommand` is where the `find` /calories feature of gordon is executed.
   * `FindDifficultyCommand` is where the `find` /difficulty feature of gordon is executed.
   * `FindIngredientsCommand` is where the `find` /ingredients feature of gordon is executed.
   * `FindPriceCommand` is where the `find` /price feature of gordon is executed.
   * `FindTimeCommand` is where the `find` /time feature of gordon is executed.

   #### Example : `FindDifficultyCommand`

   `find /difficulty Hard`

   #### Expected outcome:

    ```
    Searching by difficulty...
    1. Curry Rice (Difficulty: Hard)
    2. Coffee (Difficulty: Easy)
    ```

4. Tag Commands:
   * The Commands that are required for the  `tag` feature of Gordon are contained here.

   * `TagDeleteCommand` is where the `deleteTag` feature of gordon is executed.
   * `TagUntagCommand` is where the `untag` feature of gordon is executed.

   #### Example : `TagAddCommand`

   `tag / Curry Rice / Yummy`

   #### Expected outcome:

    ```
    Successfully tagged Curry Rice under Yummy
    ```


### Storage component

The Diagram below is the class diagram for the Storage Class

![Storage Diagram](./RenderedUML/Storage.svg)

Functions of the Storage class:
* When Gordon is launched, loads the recipes and tags stored in `saveFile.txt` using the `Scanner` Class.
* When Gordon exits, saves the recipes the list of recipes and tags in `Cookbook` to `saveFile.txt`.


### UI Component

The Diagram below is the class diagram for the UI Class

![UI Diagram](./RenderedUML/UI.svg)

Functions of the UI Class:
* Prints launch message when Gordon is first launched
* Prints exit message upon the command `exit`
* Prints help message upon the command `help`

The Diagram below is the sequence diagram for when the user needs ***help*** with the commands.

![Help Diagram](./RenderedUML/Help.svg)


### Tag Component

The diagram below is the class diagram for the Tag Class

![Tag Diagram](./RenderedUML/TagClassDiagramP.svg)

#### Functions of the Tag Class:
 
The `Tag` class contains the basic functionalities related to a _Tag_, and encapsulates the behavior of a _Tag_.
1. `getTagName` returns the _Tag Name_.
2. `containsAssociatedRecipeNames` checks for the existence of a particular _Recipe Name_ within a _Tag_.
3. `addAssociatedRecipeName` adds a _Recipe Name_ to the `ArrayList<String>` containing all such names. 
4. `removeAssociatedRecipeName` removes a _Recipe Name_ from the `ArrayList<String` containing all such names.
5. `numberofAssociatedRecipes` returns the number of _Recipes_ that each _Tag_ has under it.

>The diagram below is the sequence diagram, for when the User wishes to `untag` _Tags_ from a _Recipe_.

## Instructions for manual testing

- [I/O Tests](#io-tests)
- [JUnit Tests](#junit-tests)

### I/O Tests

#### Windows

1. Using the `cd` command in Terminal, navigate to the `test-ui-text` folder
2. Run the `runtests.bat` script
3. If the script reports no difference between ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT, the I/O test has passed.

#### Mac/Unix/Linux

1. Using the `cd` command in Terminal, navigate to the `test-ui-text` folder
2. Run the `runtests.sh` script
3. If the script reports no difference between ACTUAL.TXT and EXPECTED.TXT, the I/O test has passed

### JUnit tests

#### Pre-requisites before running any tests

1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** IDE
2. Click on the `Project` icon in the left sidebar to open the Project window.

#### Run all tests

1. Right-click on the `test` folder, and in the options window that pops up, click `Run` to run all tests.
2. You will be redirected to a view of the console, to await to result of the test.

#### Run individual tests

1. In the Project window, click the dropdown beside the `test` folder, then the `java` folder, until you find `gordon`.
2. `gordon` has 2 sub-packages, the `kitchen` package and the `util` package.
3. To run individual JUnit Tests, first select the desired `.java` file located in these packages.
4. Right-click on the `.java` file, and in the options window that pops up, click `Run` to run the test.
5. You will be redirected to a view of the console, to await to result of the test.

#### Interpreting test results

1. Depending on the number of tests ran, see the number of green ticks in the `test results` dropdown.
2. If number of green ticks equals number of tests run, then all tests have passed.
3. If there are red crosses, then there are tests that have failed.
