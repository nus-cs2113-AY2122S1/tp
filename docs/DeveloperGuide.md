## 2. Introduction

MedBot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for head nurses to manage patientsâ€™ and medical staff's personal 
information, and schedule appointments between them.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Architecture

Given below is a quick overview of the main components of MedBot and how they interact with one another.

#### 3.1.1 Main Components

![MedBot Architecture Diagram](diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The main class of MedBot is the `MedBot` class. It is responsible for initialising the other core components of MedBot
at application startup and for handling the interactions between these components.

The 4 core components of MedBot are:

* `Ui`: Handles the UI of MedBot.
* `Parser`: Parses user inputs and creates `Command` objects.
* `Scheduler`: Holds data in memory and contains the methods to read and write to it.
* `Storage`: Loads data from, and stores data to the hard disk.

In addition, the `Command` class facilitates the execution of user instructions.

#### 3.1.2 Component Interaction

Given below is a simplified sequence diagram of how the core components of MedBot interact with each other when the user
inputs the command `delete 1`.

![MedBot Architecture](diagrams/overallSequenceDiagram.png)

### 3.2 Ui Component

The Ui Component is responsible for reading user inputs and printing outputs to users.

#### Ui Class

The Ui Component is handled by the `Ui` class. It handles the reading of user inputs and the printing of outputs. 

It generates output messages through relying on the following classes.

* `PersonUi`: Generates output messages for patient- and staff-management commands.
    * `PatientUi`: Inherits `PersonUi` to generate output messages for patient-management commands.
    * `StaffUi`: Inherits `PersonUi` to generate output messages for staff-management commands.
* `SchedulerUi`: Generates output messages for scheduler commands.

#### How the Ui component works

##### Reading user inputs

When the user inputs a line of text into the terminal, terminated with a newline character, the line will be read by the
`readInput()` method of the `Ui` class which will return the String to be parsed by the Parser Component

##### Printing outputs

* After user input is parsed by `Parser`, depending on the current `viewType`, the `Ui` will call methods from
  different `Ui` subclasses
    * When `viewType` is `PATIENT_INFO`, `PatientUi` methods are called.
    * When `viewType` is `MEDICAL_STAFF_INFO`, `StaffUi` methods are called.
    * When `viewType` is `SCHEDULER`, `SchedulerUi` methods are called.

Given below is a sequence diagram of how the `Ui` component works after the `Parser`
parses `help delete` input given by a user.

![Ui Sequence Diagram](diagrams/UiSequenceDiagram.png)

### 3.3 Parser Component

The Parser Component is responsible for parsing the user input and returning the corresponding Command class object to
be executed.

Given below is a partial class diagram to better illustrate the Parser Component:

![ParserClassDiagram](diagrams/ParserClassDiagram.png)

#### How the Parser component works:

* After getting the user input, MedBot calls the `parseCommand(userInput)` method of the `Parser` class to parse the
  input.
* Depending on the current MedBot view, the `Parser` class then calls the `ParseXYZCommand()` method of the view 
  specific parser `XYZCommandParser`  (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the current view, namely `Patient`, `Staff` and 
  `Scheduler`).
* The `XYZCommandParser` then determines the type of command that the user input corresponds to and calls the 
  corresponding `parseABCCommand()` method which creates and returns the corresponding `Command` object (`ABC` is a 
  placeholder for the command type, e.g. `AddPatient`, `DeleteStaff`, `ListAppointment`).
* The methods in `ParserUtils` are used by the `Parser` and `XYZCommandParser` classes to process some parts of the user
  input.

The sequence diagram below better illustrates the working process described above:

![ParserSequenceDiagram](diagrams/ParserSequenceDiagram.png)

<em>(User is trying to add a patient's information in the PatientInfoView)</em>

### 3.4 Scheduler Component

The Scheduler Component is responsible for the storage and modification of patient, staff and appointment information.

Here is a partial class diagram to better illustrate the Scheduler Component.

![SchedulerClassDiagram](diagrams/SchedulerClassDiagram.png)

#### Scheduler Class

The `Scheduler` class consists of 3 internal lists, `patientList`, `medicalStaffList` and `schedulerAppointmentList`,
that store patient, staff and appointment information respectively. It has various public methods for the viewing and
modification of the information stored in the lists, and for the interfacing between the Scheduler and Storage
Components. A `Scheduler` class object is instantiated upon MedBot startup.

#### How the Scheduler component works:

* When MedBot calls the `.execute(Scheduler, Ui)` method of a `Command` object, a corresponding method of the
  `Scheduler` object will be called.
* This method will then view or modify the patient, staff or appointment information depending on the command.

For example:

* When the `.execute(Scheduler, Ui)` method of an `AddStaffCommand` object is called, the `addStaff(Person)` method of
  the `Scheduler` object will be called.
* The `addStaff(Person)` method will then add the `Person` to the `medicalStaffList`

### 3.5 Storage Component

The Storage Component is responsible for the persistent storage of the personal information of all patients and 
medical staff, and appointment details between the two parties. 

Here is a partial class diagram to better illustrate the Storage Component:

![SchedulerClassDiagram](diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png)

#### StorageManager Class

The `StorageManager` class performs the responsibilities of the Storage Component. It consists of a `PatientStorage`, a 
`StaffStorage` and an `AppointmentStorage` class object. The `PatientStorage`, `StaffStorage` and 
`AppointmentStorage` classes are subclasses of the `Storage` class and are responsible for the storage of patient,
staff and appointment information respectively.

#### How the Storage component works:

##### Initialization

* When MedBot is launched, `MedBot` initializes a `StorageManager` class object.
* `MedBot` then calls the `initializeStorages()` method of the `StorageManager` class object which initializes the
  `PatientStorage`, `StaffStorage` and `AppointmentStorage` class objects.
* These three `Storage` sub-classes will create a `MedBotData` directory in the current working directory if 
`MedBotData` does not already exist.
* Each of the three `Storage` classes will create their respective storage text files in `MedBotData` if they do not 
exist. 
    * `PatientStorage` will create `patient.txt` in `MedBotData
    * `StaffStorage` will create `staff.txt` in `MedBotData
    * `AppointmentStorage` will create `appointment.txt` in `MedBotData
* If the storage files exist, the respective `Storage` sub-class will ignore it.

##### Loading data:

* `StorageManager` calls the `loadStorage()` method of the `PatientStorage`, `StaffStorage` and 
 `AppointmentStorage`.
* Each of the 3 `Storage` sub-class objects then reads their corresponding storage files and stores the information in 
memory into the corresponding lists of `MedBot`.
* If there are errors in any of the storage files, an error message will be output to inform the user of the specific
line and file which has erroneous data

##### Saving data:

* After a command is executed, `MedBot` calls the `saveToStorage()` method of the `StorageManager` class object.
* `StorageManager` then calls the `saveData()` method of the `PatientStorage`, `StaffStorage` and
  `AppointmentStorage` objects.
* Each of the 3 `Storage` sub-class objects then writes the storage data into their respective data text files.


##### Format of stored data for patients and medical staff

The storage files `patient.txt` and `staff.txt` follow the same storage format when storing data. Each line of these
two storage files corresponds to the personal information of a patient or medical staff respectively:

Format:
```
ID | NRIC | NAME | PHONE_NUMBER | EMAIL | ADDRESS | HIDE_STATUS
```

Example:
```
3 | S8367812K | Sasha Alexander | 91238765 | X | Mauville City 2nd Street | S
```

Notes:
* `X`  denotes that the field is empty
* `HIDE_STATUS` refers to whether the patient/staff is to be shown or hidden
  * `S` means to "show"
  * `H` means to "hide"

##### Format of stored data for appointments

Each line of `appointment.txt` corresponds to the details of an appointment.

Format:
```
ID | DATE_TIME | PATIENT_ID | STAFF_ID
```

Example:
```
7 | 051221 0900 | 2 | 2
```


### 3.6 Command Class

The `Command` class and its subclasses are responsible for handling the execution of user instructions.

Each `Command` subclass contains:

* An `isExit()` method which return true only if it is an `Exit Command`.
* An `execute(Scheduler, Ui)` method which performs the specified user instruction and prints the output message to the 
  user.

Some `Command` subclasses also contain attributes specific to that subclass.
* E.g., the `deletePatientCommand` contains a `personId` attribute that specifies the ID of the patient that is to
  be deleted from MedBot.

There are 3 categories of commands:

1. General Commands for MedBot navigation and accessing help.
2. Person Commands which are divided into:
   1. Patient Commands for patient management in the Patient Management view.
   2. Staff Commands for staff management in the Staff Management view.
3. Appointment Commands for appointment management in the Scheduler view.

Given below is the complete list of commands and their categories:

|Command Name| Type |
|--------|---|
|Help Command|General|
|Switch Command|General|
|Get View Command|General|
|Exit Command|General|
|Add Person Command|Person|
|Delete Person Command|Person|
|View Person Command|Person|
|List Person Command|Person|
|Edit Person Command|Person|
|Find Person Command|Person|
|Hide Person Command|Person|
|Show Person Command|Person|
|Add Appointment Command|Appointment|
|Delete Appointment Command|Appointment|
|View Appointment Command|Appointment|
|List Appointment Command|Appointment|
|Edit Appointment Command|Appointment|
|Find Appointment Command|Appointment|

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Switch view feature

#### Implementation

The switch view mechanism is heavily linked to the `Parser` class. By having a
`ViewType` enumeration property in `Parser`, the view of the console can be switched by executing the
appropriate `SwitchCommand` class, which modifies the corresponding `ViewType`
of the `Parser`. The 3 possible views and the corresponding user input commands are as follows:

* `switch p` or `switch 1` - switches to the `Patient Management` view.
* `switch m` or `switch 2` - switches to the `Staff Management` view.
* `switch s` or `switch 3` - switches to the `Scheduler` view.
* `switch` - will switch to another view depending on the current view in the order shown below:

`Patient Management` --> `Staff Management` --> `Scheduler` --> `Patient Management`


Each command calls the `Parser.setViewType(ViewType)` method, which will set the corresponding
`ViewType` property in the `Parser` class. Additionally, the `Ui.clearConsoleFromIde()` method will be evoked, which
performs a pseudo clear of the console before printing a message that indicates the user has switched view.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How console is cleared:**

* Alternative 1(Current Choice)
    * Perform a pseudo-clear using multiple `System.lineSeparator()` to move the current console outputs upwards.
        * Pros: Easy to implement, system independent
        * Cons: Only works for terminals up to a certain size (bigger terminals can still see previous console outputs)
    * Perform an actual clear using the `ProcessBuilder` / `Runtime` class in java.
        * Pros: Size of terminal doesn't matter since it actually clears the console.
        * Cons: More complex implementation, need to consider different sets of implementation for different OSes, does
          not work on IDE.

### 4.2 Find feature

#### Functionality

This command will find a list of `Person` that match the given attributes in a table format.

#### Implementation

The `find` feature is facilitated by the `FindPersonCommand` class. It extends from `Command` class and overrides
the `execute()` method to achieve the desired functionality.

The example below gives a direction on how this command behaves.


1. User executes the `find n/John` command. The `Parser#parseCommand()` method will parse this command and eventually
returns a `new FindPatientCommand()` object.


2. The `MedBot#interactWithUser()` method will run the `execute()` method in the `new FindPatientCommand()` object.


3. The `execute()` method will call `PersonList#findPersons()` method with the parameter `n/John` passed in.


4. `PersonList#findPersons()` will check all the `persons` list and returns all `Person` in the list whose name contains
the string `john`. The attribute match is case-insensitive.


5. The filtered `Person` list is then passed into the `Ui` class to be displayed into a table format through
`Ui#getFindPatientsMessage()`.


### 4.3 Edit feature

#### Functionality

This command will edit a specified `Person` object with the attributes given in the command.

#### Implementation

The `edit` feature is facilitated by the `EditPersonCommand` class. It extends from `Command` class and overrides
the `execute()` method to achieve the desired functionality.

The example below gives a direction on how this command behaves.


1. User executes the `edit n/John` command when the attribute `Parser#viewType` is `PATIENT_INFO`.
The `Parser#parseCommand()` method will parse this command and eventually returns a `new EditPatientCommand()` object.


2. The `MedBot#interactWithUser()` method will run the `execute()` method in the `new EditPatientCommand()` object.


3. The `execute()` method will call `PersonList#editPerson()` method with the new `Person` object having the parameter
`n/John` passed in. (All other attributes of the object are set to `null`)


4. `PersonList#editPerson()` will attempt to replace all attributes of the old `Person`
object with the non-null attributes given in the new `Person`.


5. The edited `Person` is then passed into the `Ui` class to be displayed through`Ui#getEditPatientMessage()`.

### 4.4 Appointment management

#### Functionality

The appointment management feature is designed to allow head nurses to schedule appointments between medical staff and
patients while ensuring that there are no appointment clashes for both staff and patients.

Below is a list of key design considerations for this feature:

* Upon adding/editing an appointment, MedBot will check if the new appointment clashes with an existing appointment and
  prevent such additions/edits.
* Users should be able to edit the date/time of appointments to reschedule appointments, or to fix mistakes.
    * Users should also be able to change the staff involved in that appointment for cases where the original staff is
      not available, or to fix mistakes.
    * Users should also be able to change the patient involved in that appointment to allow for the rearranging of
      appointments, or to fix mistakes.
* Users should be able to view a list of all appointments in the system.
* Users should be able to view a list of all appointments for a particular patient/staff.

#### Implementation

Appointment management is performed by the `Scheduler` class and involves the storage and modification of `Appointment`
class objects. Appointments are managed on an hourly basis.

The `Appointment` class is an association class between `Patient` and `Staff`, with additional `appointmentId` and
`dateTimeCode` attributes. It is stored in the `SchedulerAppointmentList` class object in the `Scheduler` class and in
`PersonalAppointmentList` class objects in each `Person` class object.

The `SchedulerAppointmentList` object keeps track of all appointments in the system. This allows for the viewing of all
appointments in the system. The object consists of a `HashMap` that stores `Appointment` objects with their
`appointmentId` as their key, this prevents the system having multiple `Appointment` objects of the same
`appointmentId`.

The `PersonalAppointmentList` object in each `Person` class object keeps track of the appointments of that person. This
allows for the viewing of all appointments of that person. The object consists of a `TreeSet` that stores `Appointment`
objects with their `dateTimeCode` as the comparable value. This prevents the system from adding clashing appointments to
a patient/staff and allows their appointments to be listed by their date.

Below is a simplified sequence diagram of the `addAppointment(Appointment)` method in the `Scheduler` class:

![Add Appointment Sequence Diagram](diagrams/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

### Scheduler Commands

#### Prerequisites

* Run the following commands before running the `Scheduler` commands to populate the patient and medical staff lists
  with more data:
    1. `switch 1`
    2. `add n/Sasha Alexander i/S8367812K p/91238765 a/Mauville City 2nd Street`

    6. `switch 3`

#### Adding an appointment

* Adds an appointment to the scheduler list. MedBot will check if there are any clashes in the appointments and display
  and error message if there are any.
* The format for DATE_TIME is DDMMYY hhmm. I.e. 9 February 2021, 0800HRS should be written as 090221 0800
* Do note that the appointments are managed at an hourly basis. For example, any appointments set to any time between
  0800HRS and 0859HRS will be treated as an appointment from 0800HRS to 0859HRS. No subsequent appointment can then be
  scheduled for either the patient and the medical staff during that window.

### Saving data

* Persistent storage can be found in the `MedBotData` directory, in the same directory as the JAR file.
* Inside MedBotData, there is `appointment.txt`, `patient.txt` and `staff.txt`.

1. Dealing with corrupted data files
    1. Loading from storage, an appointment with non-existent staff ID (staff ID 10)
        1. Test case: Replace the current contents in the text file `appointment.txt` to this:
            ```
            1 | 011221 0900 | 1 | 10
            3 | 011221 1100 | 2 | 1
            ```
           and then launch MedBot using the terminal.<br><br> Expected:
            ```
            Hello, I'm MedBot!
     
            Error: Line 1 of MedBotData/appointment.txt is invalid!
     
            Please decide if you wish to:
     
            1. Enter 'exit' to exit MedBot to correct the storage files
            2. Enter other valid commands to OVERWRITE all invalid data!
         
            How can I help you today?
            ```

        * Do not enter any commands after this output. Close the terminal window and move on the next test case.<br>
