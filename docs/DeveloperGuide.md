## Introduction

Decodex is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) application for Capture-The-Flag (CTF) players to perform [encoding](#terminologies), [decoding](#terminologies), [encryption](#terminologies) and [decryption](#terminologies) of data**, which come in the form of [modules](#terminologies) that can be **executed with ease** and **without any programming** needed. Decodex also provides [recipes](#terminologies) that can also be used to link several of these [modules](#terminologies) together so that they could be executed in one go to speed up repetitive tasks. The intuitive interaction can thus help to speed up a playerâ€™s performance during CTFs and save time without having to manually code the tedious [data transformations](#terminologies).

### Purpose of This Guide

The purpose of this guide is to provide more information on our application, Decodex, such as the overall architecture, implementation and design rationales to developers who wish to contribute and enhance Decodex to it's fullest potential. As of the release of this developer guide, it is written for Decodex V2.1.

> :information_source: This guide may also serve as a start for software testers to find bugs and possibly edge cases within our applications.

### Developer Guide Usage

To better understand this developer guide, it is recommended to start off from the [Architecture](#architecture) section to have a high-level view of the application, before diving into each of the specific components to understand Decodex's design and implementation.

## Getting Started

### Setting Up the Project

1. Forking and cloning
    1. **Fork** our repository.
    2. Then, **clone** the fork onto your computer.

    > ðŸ’¡ For convenience, our repository can be found [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp).

2. Editor
    1. We highly recommend using Intellij IDEA, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
    2. However, you may still use other editors that you prefer. Just take note that most of our set ups are centered around Intellij.
3. Configure JDK
    1. Follow the guide at *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html)* to ensure Intellij is configured to use **JDK 11**, since our application runs on `Java 11`.
4. Importing project
    1. Follow the guide at *[[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html)* to import the forked project into Intellij.

    > :exclamation: Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.

5. Verifying setup
    1. Run the `decodex.Decodex.java` and try a few commands.
    2. [Run the tests](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/Testing.html) to ensure they all pass.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Additional Considerations

1. Configure the coding style
    1. If using IDEA, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEAâ€™s coding style to match ours.
   > ðŸ’¡ Tip: Optionally, you can follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] Using Checkstyle](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to find how to use the CheckStyle within IDEA e.g., to report problems as you write code.
2. Set up CI
    1. This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in `.github/workflows` folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the `master` branch or to any PR. No set up required.
3. About our code structure
    1. OOP standardized
    2. Modularized.
        1. Any changes/additions to the current commands would simply require the changes within `Parser.java`.
        2. For any changes/additions to the modules, would simply require changes within the `src/main/java/decodex/modules` folder.
    3. This structure makes it easier for us as well as developers like you to maintain and further extend the capabilities of our application.

> :exclamation: Before continuing to the Design and Implementation sections, please note that "XYZ" represents a wildcard that is used to mention commands and modules. eg. `XYZCommand` refers to `SelectCommand`, `ListCommand` etc, and `XYZModule` refers to `Base64Encoder`, `HexDecoder`, etc.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Design

### Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below shows the high-level design of Decodex.

![architecture.png](images/dg/architecture.png)

**Main Components of The Architecture**

`Decodex` is responsible for initialising the components at launch.

The rest of the program consists of 6 other components:

- `UI`: Handles user input and message output to the console
- `Logic`: Parses user input and executes commands
- `Recipe`: Manages a sequence of module to be executed
- `Module`: Manages a set of encoding and decoding processes
- `Data`: Holds the data that is to be encoded or decoded
- `Storage`: Manages the reading and writing of data to disk

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI Component

![UiClass.png](images/dg/UiClassDiagramV2.png)

The `Ui` component consists of:

- `Ui`: Manages access to the `Scanner` object that reads user input and also contains all the methods for printing to the user.

### Logic Component

Below is a partial class diagram that shows an overview of the `Logic` component.

![LogicComponent(4).png](images/dg/LogicComponent.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Logic` component consists of:

- `Parser`: Handles user input and decides the `XYZCommand` object to create.
- `RecipeCommandParser`: When `Parser` detects that a `RecipeXYZCommand` object needs to be created, the user input is handed over from `Parser` and `RecipeCommandParser` will decide the `RecipeXYZCommand` object to create.
- `Command`: An abstract class that defines the blueprint for the derived `XYZCommand` and `RecipeXYZCommand` classes. <a name="designListOfCommands"></a>
    - `InputCommand`: Takes in a string from the user and sets it as the current `Data` object to perform operations on.
    - `ShowCommand`: Shows the current Data object.
    - `HelpCommand`: Displays all command syntaxes to the user.
    - `ListCommand`: Displays all `Module` objects and loaded `Recipe` objects to the user.
    - `SelectCommand`: Executes a supported `Module` object or a loaded `Recipe` object on the current `Data` object and replaces it with the resulting `Data` object from the execution.
    - `ResetCommand`: Reverts the current `Data` object to a state before any modules/recipes were executed on it.
    - `ExitCommand`: Exits the application.
    - `RecipeNewCommand`: Creates a new `Recipe` object with name provided by the user and creates a save file for it on the file system.
    - `RecipeSelectCommand`: Set a `Recipe` object as the recipe that is currently being edited.
    - `RecipeDeselectCommand`: Set the currently edited `Recipe` object as no longer being edited.
    - `RecipeListCommand`: Display all `Module` objects in a `Recipe` object.
    - `RecipePushCommand`: Appends a `Module` object to the `Recipe` object that is currently being edited.
    - `RecipePopCommand`: Removes the latest `Module` object from the `Recipe` object that is currently being edited.
    - `RecipeResetCommand`: Removes all `Module` objects from the `Recipe` object that is currently being edited.
    - `RecipeDeleteCommand`: Deletes a `Recipe` object from the application as well as its corresponding save file on the file system.


Below is the class diagram showing the association between the `Decodex` class and the `Parser` class.

![ParserClass.png](images/dg/ParserClass.png)

Below is the class diagram showing the association between the abstract `Command` class and its `XYZCommand` and `RecipeXYZCommand` classes mentioned [earlier](#designListOfCommands).

![CommandClassDiagram](images/dg/CommandClassDiagram.png)

### Data Component

Below is a partial class diagram that shows an overview of the `Data` component.

![DataComponent.png](images/dg/DataComponentPartialDiagramV2.png)

The `Data` component consists of:

1. `Data`: Used to hold the bytes which the data transformations will act on.
2. `DataManager`: Holds a reference to the current `Data` object and updates it when a `Module` or `Recipe` is executed.

Below is the class diagram showing the association between the `Decodex` class, the `DataManager` class and the `Data` class.

![DataClass.png](images/dg/DataClass.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Module Component

Below is a partial class diagram that shows an overview of the `Module` component.

![ModuleComponent.png](images/dg/ModuleComponent.png)

The `Module` component consists of:

- `Module`: An abstract class that defines the blueprint for the derived `XYZModule` classes.
    - `Base64Encoder`, `Base64Decoder`: Performs base64 encoding/decoding operations
    - `HexEncoder`, `HexDecoder`: Performs hexadecimal encoding/decoding operations
    - `BinaryEncoder`, `BinaryDecoder`: Performs binary encoding/decoding operations
    - `RotEncoder`: Performs rotational cipher operation
- `ModuleManager`: Decides and generates the necessary `Module` objects to be added to `Recipe` objects or to be executed on `Data` objects.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is the class diagram showing the association between the `Decodex` class, the `ModuleManager` class.

![ModuleManagerClass.png](images/dg/ModuleManagerClass.png)

Below is the class diagram showing the association between the abstract `Module` class and its derived `XYZModule` classes.

![ModuleClassDiagram](images/dg/ModuleClassDiagramv3.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Recipe Component

Below is a partial class diagram that shows an overview of the `Recipe` component.

![RecipeComponent.png](images/dg/RecipeComponent.png)

The `Recipe` component consists of:

- `Recipe`: Holds a chain of `Module` objects that, when ran, will execute sequentially on a `Data` object.
- `RecipeManager`: Manages all loaded `Recipe` objects and holds a reference to the `Recipe` object that is currently being edited.

![RecipeClass.png](images/dg/RecipeClass.png)

> :pen: The reason for having `Recipe` objects is to enable users to run multiple modules at one go sequentially.

### Storage Component

![StorageClass.png](images/dg/StorageClass.png)

The `Storage` component consists of:

- `Storage` : Performs all file related operations such as reading/saving to files and deleting of files.

To add on, the `Storage` component is designed to access only the following folders:

1. `recipe/` : For recipe files.

> :pen: The rationale behind standardizing a specific folder to read/save to, is to ensure that all relevant files can be found in the same location, which makes it easier for users to find the files they are looking for.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Implementation

This section focuses on explaining the specific application flows and the interactions between the classes and their methods.

:exclamation: The lifeline of the objects should terminate at the destroy marker (`X`), however due to a limitation of the PlantUML software, the lifeline extends beyond the destroy marker.

### Decodex Initialisation

Below shows the sequence diagram of the initialisation of Decodex.

![Decodex Initialisation](images/dg/DecodexInitSeq.png)

During the initialisation sequence of Decodex, all the dependencies (i.e `DataManager`, `ModuleManager` .etc) are instantiated, which will later on be passed to the relevant commands and methods for usage.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Decodex Main Logic

Below is the sequence diagram showing the overall flow of Decodex.

![Decodex Main Logic](images/dg/DecodexMainSeq.png)

This main logic occurs after the initialisation sequence in the previous figure. It comprises of the main loop that provides the interactivity to the user by reading input from them and attempting to execute it as a command. The loop terminates when the user enters the `exit` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Parser - Basic Command Logic

Below is the sequence diagram that shows the overall flow of the `Parser` logic.

![Parser Basic Command Logic](images/dg/ParserBasicSeq.png)

The flow of the `Parser` logic:

1. Receives the user input and parses it to get the command type.
2. Prepares the corresponding `XYZCommand`.
    1. However, if the command is a `RecipeXYZCommand`, it will be passed to `RecipeCommandParser` for subcommand parsing.
3. Returns the `Command` object back to `Decodex`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Parser - Recipe Command Logic

Below is the sequence diagram that shows the overall flow of the `RecipeCommandParser` logic.

![Parser Recipe Command Logic](images/dg/ParserRecipeSeq.png)

The general process of the `RecipeCommandParser` logic consists of:

1. Receives the user input from `Parser` then parses it to get the subcommand type.
2. Prepares the corresponding `RecipeXYZCommand`
3. Returns the `RecipeXYZCommand` object back to `Decodex`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Modules

The abstract `Module` class serves as the base class for all modules to be inherited from. It contains essential information that must be present in every module developed for Decodex.

- `name`: The name of the module
- `description`: The description of the module
- `run(Data data)`: The abstract method to process the provided `Data`

The `name` and `description` variables must be set during the instantiation of the module, that is to say in the constructor.

The abstract `run(Data data)` method should be implemented to access the bytes inside the given `Data` object, perform some processing on them, construct a new `Data` object from the results and return it.
There are two groups of modules supported by Decodex:

- Modules that do not take in any parameters
- Modules that take in at least one parameter

**Modules that do not take in any parameters**

This group of modules do not require any additional parameters as their encoding and decoding processes are fixed. Hence, the constructors of these modules should not receive any parameters.

**Modules that take in at least one parameter**

This group of modules require at least one additional parameter as their encoding and decoding processes are dependent on the provided parameters. The constructors of these modules should receive parameters as required and stored in private variables. These variables will then be used in their respective `run(Data data)` method.

The current implementation of the abstract `Module` class provides a strong foundation to be inherited by much more complex modules, and developed into full-functioning modules for Decodex.

### List of Commands

> :information_source: For the following sequence diagrams for XYZCommands, the parameters in the `run()` method is omitted to improve readability.

#### HelpCommand

![HelpCommand](images/dg/HelpCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

When the `Parser` recognises the `help` keyword from the user input, a `HelpCommand` is instantiated.

## Appendix D: Glossary

- **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X

**Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on, testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

## Appendix E: Instructions for Manual Testing

### Start and Shutdown

1. Ensure you have Java version `11` or above installed on your computer.
2. Next, download the latest `decodex.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-3/tp/releases).
3. Copy the `decodex.jar` into an empty folder.
4. Run the `decodex.jar` on your command prompt by typing in `java -jar decodex.jar` the press `Enter`.
5. Type a command in the command box after the `Decodex [] >` prompt and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will show a list available commands, their respective descriptions and syntaxes.
6. To exit Decodex, use the `exit` command. Alternatively, Decodex can be exited using `Ctrl+C` or by closing the command prompt window.

### Inputting Data

When entering data, `Decodex` requires a specific format such that the data is entered correctly.


> :information_source: Notes about the input data
> - The program will consider **all characters following the first space character as data** in the input command. You may observe leading and trailing whitespaces in the output.
>
> - **Non-printable characters** (e.g. null characters) may not be correctly displayed and could potentially scramble the user interface.
> 
> - There will only be one instance of data at any time. Running the `input` command will overwrite the current data that is stored in the program.


Here are some example inputs you can try:

> :exclamation: `<space>` indicates that there are extra spaces in the input. Replace `<space>` with a space character when running the example commands below.

- `input hello<space>world` : Inputs "hello world" as data into the Decodex.
- `input <space>hello<space>world<space>` : Inputs " hello world " as data into Decodex.
- `input goodbye<space>world` : Inputs "goodbye world" as data into the Decodex.

For subsequent examples below, this guide assumes that the original input data is `goodbye world`.

### Listing Modules and Recipes

The `list` command has 3 variations:

- List all modules and recipes
- List all modules
- List all recipes

The first command lists every single modules and recipes which is the combined output of the other 2 commands. No recipes will be found if no recipes have been created.

- Test case `list`
  - Expected (if no recipes exists):

```
Here is the list of supported modules:
  base64encode - Encodes the data using Base64 format.
  base64decode - Decodes the data using Base64 format.
  hexencode    - Converts the input string to hexadecimal bytes.
  hexdecode    - Converts a hexadecimal string back into its raw value.
  binencode    - Encodes the data using binary format.
  bindecode    - Decodes the data using binary format.
  rotencode    - Rotates alphabetical characters by a specified integer offset.

You do not have any recipes
```
- Test case `list`
  - Expected (if some recipes exists):

```
Here is the list of supported modules:
  base64encode - Encodes the data using Base64 format.
  base64decode - Decodes the data using Base64 format.
  hexencode    - Converts the input string to hexadecimal bytes.
  hexdecode    - Converts a hexadecimal string back into its raw value.
  binencode    - Encodes the data using binary format.
  bindecode    - Decodes the data using binary format.
  rotencode    - Rotates alphabetical characters by a specified integer offset.

Here is the list of available recipes:
  myRecipe1
  myRecipe_123
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Test case `list modules`
    - Expected:

```
Here is the list of supported modules:
  base64encode - Encodes the data using Base64 format.
  base64decode - Decodes the data using Base64 format.
  hexencode    - Converts the input string to hexadecimal bytes.
  hexdecode    - Converts a hexadecimal string back into its raw value.
  binencode    - Encodes the data using binary format.
  bindecode    - Decodes the data using binary format.
  rotencode    - Rotates alphabetical characters by a specified integer offset.
```

- Test case `list recipes`
    - Expected (if no recipes exists):

```
You do not have any recipes
```

- Test case `list recipes`
    - Expected (if some recipes exists):

```
Here is the list of available recipes:
  myRecipe1
  myRecipe_123
```

### Running Modules and Resetting

Running the data through multiple modules and resetting it to its original data is shown below. Here, the current data refers to the output from the previous ran module and by default, if no modules is ran, then current data is the same as input data, i.e. `goodbye world`.

1. Following this order of execution:
    1. `select module hexencode` : Encodes the (original) data with Hexadecimal encoding.
    2. `select module base64encode` : Encodes the current data with Base64 encoding.
    3. `select module rotencode 5` : Encodes the current data by rotating the alphabetic characters by offset of +5.
    4. `select module binencode` : Encodes the current data with Binary encoding.
2. The resulting output would be something unintelligible.
3. In order to obtain the original data, running `reset` will return the current data back to the original data that was inputted. i.e. `goodbye world` .

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing Modules in Recipes

List the module sequences in previously created recipes.

- Test case: `recipe list`
    - Expected (if a non-empty recipe was selected for editing):

```
Here is the list of modules in recipe myRecipe1:

  2. base64encode
  3. hexencode
```

- Test case: `recipe list`
  - Expected (if an empty recipe was selected for editing):

```
[x] There are no modules in the recipe
```

- Test case: `recipe list`
  - Expected (if no recipe was selected for editing):

```
[x] No recipe selected for editing.
```

- Test case: `recipe list <recipe name>` (i.e. `<recipe name>` is `recipe1`)
  - Expected (if recipe is not empty):

```
Here is the list of modules in recipe myRecipe1:
  1. base64encode
  2. base64encode
  3. hexencode
```

- Test case: `recipe list <recipe name>`
  - Expected (if recipe is empty):

```
[+] There are no modules in the recipe
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Creating Recipes

Creating recipes can be done using the `recipe new` command.

An example of a valid recipe creation command is shown below.

- Test case: `recipe new special_Recipe1`
    - Expected:

```
[+] Recipe special_Recipe1 created successfully
```

Some examples of invalid recipe creation commands are shown below.

- Test case: `recipe new Invalid Recipe N@me!`
    - Expected:

```
[x] Too many command arguments
```

- Test case: `recipe new XÃ†A-12`
    - Expected:

```
[x] Recipe names can contain only alphabets, numbers and underscores and must be non-empty.
```

> :bulb: The expected output of the test case above might exceed an A4 page's width when viewing in PDF format or when printed. See the full output on the online developer guide [here](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-t10-3.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#creating-recipes).

### Switching Recipes for Modification

Switching of recipes to modify them. Below shows an example of the switch from one recipe to another. The `recipe deselect` command is optional when switching between recipes.

Assuming there are 3 recipes `myRecipe1`, `myRecipe_123` and `special_Recipe1`.

- Test case: `recipe select myRecipe1`
    - Expected: Selects the recipe `myRecipe1` for editing.

```

    ```
    [+] Removed base64decode module from recipe special_Recipe1
    ```

5. Test case: `recipe push base64encode`. The correct module `base64encode` is added to the recipe.
    1. Expected: The `base64encode` module is added to the recipe.

    ```
    [+] Added base64encode module to recipe special_Recipe1
    ```

6. Test case: `recipe push rotencode 5`. Add the `rotencode` module with argument `5` to the recipe.
    1. Expected: The `rotencode` module with argument `5` is added to the recipe.

    ```
    [+] Added rotencode module to recipe special_Recipe1
    ```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Running Recipes

Runs the modules in a recipe.

Assuming the input data is `hello world` and the previously created recipe `special_Recipe1` is available.

- Test case: `select recipe special_Recipe1`
    - Expected: The modules in `special_Recipe1` is run.

```
[+] Modules executed: hexencode, base64encode, rotencode 5

```

### Deleting Recipes

Deleting a recipe.

- Test case: `recipe delete special_Recipe1`
  - Expected:
```
[+] Recipe special_Recipe1 has been deleted
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage of Recipe Files

*Testing of invalid recipe files on startup*

All recipes are stored in their respective files with the name `recipeName.txt` in the `recipe/` directory where `recipeName` denotes their actual recipe name in Decodex. It is highly recommended to ensure that Decodex can access these files/directory to work properly.

Details of Recipe Files:

- If the `recipe/` directory does not exist yet (first time running it), Decodex will create it automatically.
- All recipe files are found in the `recipe/` directory and is loaded into Decodex on startup. Only valid recipe files (e.g. correct filetype and suffix of `.txt`) with the valid stored formats are loaded successfully into Decodex.
- Created automatically when a new recipe is created on Decodex is successfully created using `recipe new` command, but the contents of the corresponding recipe file will be empty.
- Updated automatically whenever a change (e.g. adding/removing modules) happens successfully in the respective recipe on Decodex.
- Deleted automatically whenever the corresponding recipe on Decodex is deleted successfully using `recipe delete`.
- The table below denotes the different behaviours on startup for an invalid `recipe/` directory and 2 invalid recipe files, assuming they are `myRecipe.txt` and `iRecipe.md`.

| Wrong module syntaxes (e.g. If `rotencode` is missing an argument) - `myRecipe.txt` contains invalid module syntaxes.<br><br> For more information on what are some examples of valid/invalid syntaxes, please refer to [Appendix F](#appendix-f---examples-of-saved-recipe-files) | `[x] Failed to load following recipes into Decodex: myRecipe` | Decodex will try to load the contents of `myRecipe.txt` line by line to translate them into modules which are then loaded into the recipe called `myRecipe` in Decodex. Since, in this case, one of the module syntax is incorrect, the recipe fails to be loaded. If there are multiple recipe files that also failed to be loaded due to module syntaxes, then  they are appended in the error message. <br>To avoid this from happening, users are recommended to only use Decodex to make changes to these recipes. |

## Appendix F - Examples of Saved Recipe Files

> :information_source: The modules in a recipe are stored in the recipe file in the format of `<moduleName> {moduleArgument}` where values in `<>` are compulsory while those in `{}` are optional.

**Below shows some of the case scenarios for valid and invalid module syntaxes in the saved recipe files.**

Sample of valid module syntaxes in a recipe file:

1. An example of the contents of a recipe file with valid module syntax on each line

```
    base64encode
    rotencode 13
    hexencode
```

Samples of invalid module syntaxes in a recipe file:

1. An example of the contents of a recipe file with invalid module argument.
    1. On line 2, an argument is expected for rotencode module, but it is missing.
```
    base64encode
    rotencode
    hexencode
```

2. An example of the contents of a recipe file with invalid module name.
    1. On line 1, the module name of "base64" does not exist/available on Decodex.
```
    base64
    rotencode 13
    hexencode
```
