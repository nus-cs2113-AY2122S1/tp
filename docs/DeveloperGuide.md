## Setting up and Getting started

### Set up project

1. Fork this [repo](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-F12-2/tp), and clone the fork into your computer.

2. Ensure that you have [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows) and [JDK 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) installed.

3. Configure the JDK
   - Follow the guide at [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the JDK](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html) to ensure Intellij is configured to use JDK 11.
   
4. Import the project as a Gradle project
   - Follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Importing a Gradle project](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html) to import the project into IDEA.
   - Note: Importing a Gradle project is slightly different from importing a normal Java project.
   
5. Verify the setup
   - Locate the file src/main/java/GetJackd.java then run the GetJackd.main() and try a few commands.
   - Run the test to ensure they all pass.


### Before writing code

1. **Configure the coding style**

   - If using IDEA, follow the guide [[se-edu/guides] IDEA: Configuring the code style](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to set up IDEA's coding style to match ours.
   
2. **Set up CI**

   - This project comes with a GitHub Actions config files (in .github/workflows folder). When GitHub detects those files, it will run the CI for your project automatically at each push to the master branch or to any PR. No set up required.
   
3. **Learn the design**

   - When you are read to start coding, we recommend that you get some sense of the overall design by reading the following.

## Design & implementation

### Basic Architecture

![img.png](umldg/BasicArchitecture.png)

__Note:__ Lines in this diagram denote that the component has references to most classes inside the component the arrow
is pointing towards, whereas dotted lines denote dependencies.
* `Ui` : In charge of reading user input and printing the results on the terminal.
* `Main` : Main of whole application.
* `Storage` : In charge of storing and loading user data from the json file.
* `Data` : Contains data of all workouts the user has added.
* `Parser` : Parses user input and returns Command object.
* `Command` : Holds all information related to a type of command and can be executed.
* `Logger` : Contains method to set up the logger for each class.
* `Exceptions` : Contains all specialized exceptions created for this application.

The `Main` component is run by`GetJackd.java` while the rest of the components are run by the respective classes
inside their packages.

Basic sequence of events:
1. User inputs data which is read by `Ui` inside `Main`
2. `Main` passes the input to  `Parser` which returns a `Command`
3. The `Command` is executed.
   * If the command edits the `Data` component (e.g. create a Workout) then `Storage` reflects the changes
     in the json file.
4. `Ui` acknowledges the command and shows the result of the Command if any.

Below is a high-level sequence diagram showing the `create` Command

![img.png](umldg/BasicArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

**`showResultToUser(CommandResult)`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Data Component

Location : `seedu.duke.data`

![img.png](umldg/DataClassDiagram.png)

__Note:__
* `WorkoutList` : List of all Workout Routines.
* `Workout` : A specific Workout Routine e.g. "Leg day" could be a routine created for exercises that focus on legs.
* `DeadlineWorkout` : Workout with a deadline attached to it.
* `Exercise` : A specific exercise eg. "Squats" could be an exercise added to "Leg day." 

The `data` component defines the format in which data is temporarily stored while the application is running.
As seen in the figure above, the highest level of abstraction is the `WorkoutList` which stores all the workout routines
that the user has currently stored. Next, the `Workout` refers to a Workout Routine and stores a variable number of 
exercises (in the form of an `Exercise` object). Lastly, `Exercise` stores the exercise with attributes:
* `description` corresponding to the name of the exercise.
* `reps` corresponding to the number of times the exercise is done in a given set.
* `sets` corresponding to the number of times the whole exercise is repeated.

__Storage.models__: `addToWorkoutListModel(WorkoutModel workout)` and `addToWorkoutModel(ExerciseModel exercise)` from the `storage.models` component
are called in the methods of `Workout` and `Exercise` respectively. This causes the dependency on `WorkoutModel` and `WorkoutListModel` as seen in the UML Diagram.
These methods are required to convert the current `WorkoutList` into a `WorkoutListModel` which can then be easily converted
into a json String with the help of a `ObjectMapper` from the [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) Library.
Below is a sequence diagram showing how this all happens:

![img.png](umldg/DataSequenceDiagram.png)

1. First `convertAllWorkoutsToStorageModel()` is called when the whole `WorkoutList` is to be converted into its model counterpart.
   1. For each `Workout` in the `WorkoutList`, its `convertToWorkoutStorageModel()` method is called.
   2. In this method a new `WorkoutModel` is created which acts as the model counterpart for this `Workout` object.
      1. For each `Exercise` in this `Workout` object, its `convertToExerciseStorageModel(WorkoutModel)` is called.
      2. In this method a new `ExerciseModel` is created which acts as the model counterpart for this `Exercise` object.
      3. Each `ExerciseModel` created this way is added to the `WorkoutModel`.
   3. Each `WorkoutModel` created this way is added to the `WorkoutListModel`.
2. Once all `Workout` objects are converted to `WorkoutModel` objects, the `WorkoutListModel` has all the data which was in 
   the `WorkoutList` and now can be converted into a json String to be stored in the json File.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage Component

Location: `seedu.duke.storage`

![img.png](umldg/StorageDiagram.png)

__Note:__
* `Storage` : Deals with loading tasks from the json file and saving tasks in the json file.
* `JsonUtil` : Handles functions required to convert Java Objects to JSON objects and vice versa using the Jackson Library.

The `Storage` component,
- can save workout list data in json format, and read them back into corresponding Java objects.
- depends on some classes in the `Models` component within Storage (because the Storage component can only save/retrieve objects that belong to the Model).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command Component

Location : `seedu.duke.command`

![img.png](umldg/CommandDiagram.png)


__Note:__

* `Command` : Deals with executing user commands on `workout` and `workoutList`.
* `XYZExerciseCommand` are child classes which inherit from the `Command` class and implement/execute exercise related
commands.
* `XYZWorkoutCommand` are child classes which inherit from the `Command` class and implement/execute workout related
commands.
* `XYZCommand` are child classes which inherit from the `Command` class and implement/execute miscellaneous commands.

`ExitCommand` is also one of the commands that checks whether the command called from `main()` is an exitCommand or not.

Exercise commands
* `AddExerciseCommand` : To add a new exercise to a workout.
* `DisplayExerciseCommand` : To display all the exercises in a workout.
* `MarkExerciseAsDoneCommand` : To mark an exercise of a user given index as completed in a workout. 
* `RemoveExerciseCommand` : To remove an exercise from the workout based on user given indices.
* `EditExerciseCommand` : To edit an exercise in a workout based on user given indices.

Workout commands
* `CreateWorkoutCommand` : To create a new workout.
* `DeleteWorkoutCommand` : To delete an existing workout.
* `EnterWorkoutCommand` : To enter inside a workout in order to make necessary changes pertaining to that workout.
* `ExitWorkoutCommand` : To exit from a workout to the main page.
* `ListWorkoutsCommand` : To list all the workouts.
* `RecommendWorkoutCommand` : To suggest pre-set workouts based on user given difficulty level.

Miscellaneous commands
* `ClearCommand` : To clear all the exercises in a workout or all the workouts.
* `HelpCommand` : To display the help message for a particular command when typed incorrectly.
* `IncorrectCommand` : To show error message when command is invalid.
* `SearchCommand` : To list all workouts or exercises matching the keyword.

The basic `Command` parent class mainly has a method to execute necessary actions involving the `workout` 
and `workoutList`, storage of data and the user interface.

Most commands require the use of `workoutIndex` and `exerciseIndex` to execute commands for the user mentioned 
workout/exercise. However, there are other commands which do not need them such as `HelpCommand`, `ListWorkoutsCommand` 
and a few more.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Parser / CommandManager Component
Location: `seedu.duke.parser`

![img.png](umldg/CommandManager.png)

__Note:__
* `CommandManager` : Creates command objects based on User input
* `Parser` : Deals with processing raw user input and returns information to the Command Manager on what commands to create

The `CommandManager` component deals with taking the raw input String from the user and making sense of it.
It's primary purpose is to take the user input and create a Command object corresponding to the user input. 

The `generateCommand()` method in the CommandManager class creates a Parser object based on the type of command the user entered.
The parser will then extract the relevant information and command arguments from the input String, then create a new Command object
with the correct parameters.

The basic `Parser` parent class has all the required methods to:
* Identify the type of command the user inputs
* Extract the command arguments

`XYZCommandParser` are child classes which inherit from the `Parser` class and implement command-specific parsing and Command creation.

Not all the Commands will have a defined Parser, as some commands do not take arguments and will always execute the same way
(e.g. `bye` or `list`)

Other commands that require parsing the command arguments in different ways, such are extracting exercise and workout index, will require
further processing. This additional processing is defined by each Command's corresponding Parser.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Ui Component

Location: `seedu.duke.ui`

![img.png](umldg/UI.png)

__Note:__
* `CommandResult` : Contains all the information we want to display to the user.
* `Command` : Abstract class that tells us whether we are in the main level or in a workout. If the user is in Workout Mode, i.e. `workoutMode != 0`, then the messages will be displayed with an indent.
* `Ui` : Handles the display of information to the user.

`itemList` in `CommandResult` is used to store a workout list or exercise list. `itemList` is used when a single list is needed to be shown to the user. Commands such as `display` and `list` use `itemList` to store information.

`map` in `CommandResult` is used to store multiple lists that can be workout lists or exercise lists. The lists are the value in the map, and the accompanying message is stored as the key in the map. Commands such as `Search` and `Recommend` use `map` to store information to be displayed to the user.

`isTable` decides whether a list should be displayed to the user as a list or as a table.
