## 3. Features

### Notes about the command format:

* Words in UPPER_CASE are arguments to be supplied by the user.  
e.g. in `history -g GAME_MODE`, `GAME_MODE` is an argument which can be used as `history -g time`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.  
e.g. `-g GAME_MODE [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS]` can be used as `-g time -n 9` or as `-g time`
* Parameters can be in any order.  
e.g. if command specifies `history -g GAME_MODE [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS]`, `history [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS] -g GAME_MODE`  
is also acceptable.  
Note: One parameter is defined as the option e.g. `-g` and its value (if there is such a field) e.g. `time`
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, 
only the first occurrence of the parameter will be taken  
e.g. if you specify `history -g time -g time -n 10`, only `history -g time -n 10` will be taken. 
* For commands which have a `-h` parameter, if `-h` is among the parameters provided, all other parameters will be 
ignored and the guide for that command will be displayed.    
e.g `history -g time -h -n 10` will be interpreted as `history -h`.
* All parameters which do not conform to the command syntax will be ignored.  
e.g.2 `clear -gtime` will be interpreted as `clear`

### 3.1 Set Content: `content`
Set the typing content before the game.  
There are two game modes in Typist:

* time-limited (aim to type as much as possible in a limited time)
* word-limited (aim to type a chosen number of words as fast as possible)

Format: `content` `1-3` `[optional]`

After entering `content`, user can type an integer from 1-3 to choose from following:

1. Opening of famous books
2. Wikipedia article
3. Random sentence of custom length

<!-- input example --> 

Examples
* `content` `1` `3`

<!-- -->

### 3.2 Open Game: `game`
Start a typing game.  
Format: `game -GAME_MODE [GAME_LIMIT] [-c] [-sn]`

* GAME_MODE 
  * `word` for game in Word Limit Mode 
  * `time` for game in Time Limit Mode  

#### 3.2.1 Word Limit Game
  In a Word-Limit game, user needs to specify the total number of words 
they want to type. Game will terminate once they finish typing the specified 
number of words. 
* Format: `game -word [WORD_LIMIT] [-c] [-sn]`
* Example: `game -word`
* ```
  game -word 
     | Enter how many words you want the game to run: 
  10
     | Timer will start once you entered "start":
  start
     | Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy
  lorem ipsum is simply dummy
     | Your progress:5/10
  ```
* Exit: `Exit` allows user to terminate the current game.

#### 3.2.2 Time Limit Game
In a Time-Limit Game, user needs to specify the duration 
they want to type. Timer will stop once the duration is reached
and terminates the game at the same time. 
>**NOTE**: 
> The time limit that user inputs needs to be a positive integer that represents time in seconds. 
> It also needs to be multiple of 30. 

* Format: `game -time [TIME_LIMIT] [-c] [-sn]`
* Example: `game -time`  
* ```
  game -time
     | Enter how long you want the game to run:
  60
     | Timer will start once you entered "start":
  start
     | Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
     | Timer's Up!
  ```

    **Exceeding Time:**  
    When you are at the last sentence. Even though Timer is up, the game will wait
    until you finish the last sentence to terminate. You will be informed of the exceeding time,
    and it will count towards your game summary.

#### Optional arguments
* SET_CONTENT `-c`: allows user to set input content before game starts.
* START_NOW `-sn`: allows timer to start immediately without the "start timer" prompt.
* GAME_LIMIT: a positive integer that sets the word/time limit of the game 
 without the "enter limit" prompt.
  > **NOTE**:
  > if you want to specify GAME_LIMIT, it needs to be right after the GAME_MODE argument.
  > If the GAME_LIMIT entered is invalid, game will still start but with the "enter limit" prompt. 

  > Any ERROR in the _optional arguments_ will prompt a message but will not terminate the command.
  > The game will still start as if the optional argument is not given.

### !Warning: Editing the data file
Typists is a game application and only game records will be stored. 
Gamers should not edit the data it will manipulate the integrity of the records.
In the event where the data is edited and the wrong format is inputted, the file contents will be cleared, 
hence losing all the game data.

### 3.7 Man Pages: `man`

Review the man pages for different command if you need help.  
Format: `man [COMMAND]`
* `man` with out specifying the command will display the default man page.

Example: `man clear`  
```
     | Clear all past game records.
     | Command format: clear [-g GAME_MODE] [-h]
```

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Copy and paste the save data under the same working directory.

**Q**: The wiki page contains error messages. What should I do?

**A**: Some characters might not be supported by the CLI. You can search for another page as an alternative.

**Q**: Why does the time limit need to be a multiple of 30?

**A**: It's a design choice. You can select the word limit game if you find it too restricting.
