# Traveller User Guide

## Introduction
![Traveller](./documentationPics/logo.png)

Thank you for choosing to use Traveller!

Traveller is a travel planner app that is designed to help holidaymakers like you plan your overseas trips with ease.

Traveller is created for individuals who prefer to use a Command Line Interface (CLI) over a Graphical User Interface (GUI), 
while still retaining the ease of use of a GUI.

Use Traveller so that you can plan your trips with ease and focus on what matters most: Fun!

### What is a Command Line Interface (CLI)?
A CLI is a way of interacting with applications via lines of text, instead of the usual way of clicking on the application.
Each computer will have their own CLI, such as the Windows Powershell and the macOS's Terminal.

### What is this guide for?

## 1. Quick Start
This section provides you with a short guide on how to get Traveller up and running on your computer.

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed. You can install it from this 
[link](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11).
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) To check your java version, enter `java -version`.
2. Download the latest version of `Traveller.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/releases).
3. Move the executable jar file to an empty directory of your choice.
4. Navigate to the directory containing `Traveller.jar` in your desired CLI and enter `java -jar Traveller.jar`.
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) If you are unfamiliar with a CLI, you can use the command prompt/terminal provided by 
> your computer. For Windows, open your Start Menu and enter `cmd`. For macOS, search `terminal` in LaunchPad. For Linux,
> you can use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T` or searching `terminal` in the Dash.
> 
> If you have moved `Traveller.jar` to your Desktop, enter `cd Desktop` to navigate to the
> Desktop directory.

   You should see Traveller's welcome message as shown below.

   ![Welcome](./documentationPics/welcome.png)

## 2. Features
This section provides in-depth explanations for all commands that Traveller supports and how to use them.
As well as useful tips and tricks for you to fully utilise Traveller.

For a quick summary of all commands, please click [here](#5-command-summary) instead.

> ![](documentationPics/info.png) As Traveller is a CLI based app, what and how you type is *very important*.
> Each command has its specific format so that Traveller can understand what you want to do!

<br/>

### 2.1. Getting help: `help`
The **help** command shows you the basic commands that are supported by Traveller.
The purpose of the help command is to ensure that even if there is no internet connection, the user is able to utilise the CLI without having to refer to the user guide.

#### Format: `help`

<br/>

### 2.2. Creating a trip: `new`
The **new** command creates a new trip in your trip list.

#### Format: `new TRIP_NAME /from SOURCE_COUNTRY /to DESTINATION_COUNTRY`
   * Keywords `/from` and `/to` must be included **before** the SOURCE_COUNTRY and DESTINATION_COUNTRY respectively.
   * `SOURCE_COUNTRY` and `DESTINATION_COUNTRY` destinations must be [supported countries codes](#4-supported-countries-summary).
   * Trips cannot be named `all` or contain the character `/`.

#### Usage Example:

```
________________________________________________________________
$ new FamilyTrip2021 /from SIN /to MLY
________________________________________________________________
	You have just created a new trip called FamilyTrip2021.
________________________________________________________________
```
> ![](documentationPics/info.png) A trip is a basic building block of Traveller. To start planning your trips, 
> create a trip using this command first. Then, when planning your trip, all details will be tagged to this trip that 
> you have created.
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) If you have accidentally created unwanted trips, use the 
> [delete](#26-deleting-a-trip-delete) command to delete the unwanted trips.
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) After creating a trip, you can [view](#25-viewing-trips-view) the trip to find 
> the shortest flight path to get to your desired country (Yes, it is automated! :)).
> 
> ![](documentationPics/warning.png) If you encounter an issue where either your Start or End destinations are not recognised by Traveller.
> Take a look [here](#4-supported-countries-summary) for the supported countries!

<br/>

### 2.3. Adding a day to trip: `add-day`
The **add-day** command allows you to add any number of days to your trip, as your overseas trip may span multiple days.

#### Format: `add-day TRIP_NAME /day NUMBER_OF_DAYS`
   * The maximum number of days allowed per trip is 30 days.

#### Usage Example:

```
____________________________________________________________
$ add-day FamilyTrip2021 /day 3
____________________________________________________________
	Added 3 days to trip FamilyTrip2021.
____________________________________________________________
```

> ![](documentationPics/info.png) After creating a trip, what's next is to specify the number of days your trip will 
> last. Use this command to do so.
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) If you have accidentally created more days than you want, you can delete the days 
> you have created at any time using the [delete-day](#27-deleting-a-day-from-a-trip-delete-day) command.

<br/>

### 2.4. Adding an item to a day: `add-item`
The **add-item** command adds an item to a day of your trip. This item represents an activity that you will do in that day.

$ add-item trip1 /day 0 /time 1900 /name Check-in to HolidayInn
________________________________________________________________
	Added a new item to day 0 of trip FamilyTrip2021.
________________________________________________________________
```

> ![](documentationPics/info.png) In each day of your trip, you will want to have multiple items planned out, 
> such as visiting a museum or relaxing at the beach. Use this command to create these items in your trip. Items are
> very flexible in what they can represent, so do use them to their fullest!
> 
> ![](documentationPics/info.png) Days are 0-indexed based. That is, the first day of your trip is day 0.
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) If you decided that you want to remove some items, simply use 
> the [delete-item](#28-deleting-an-item-from-a-day-delete-item) command.
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) If your item spans the whole day, just type in `All day` for the time field!
> 
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) As of the current version (v2.1), items in each day are not sorted by time and will 
> appear in the order in which they are added. As such, do add items in chronological order if the order is important.

<br/>

### 2.5. Viewing trips: `view`
The **view** command displays and shows you details of your existing trips.

_________________________________________________________________________________

```

> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) Edit-item only allows you to change the time or name of a given item, 
> not the name or source and destination countries of your trip.

```

> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) Search allows you to find words that contain the phrase, no 
> matter how large or small! Eg 'a', 'apple'.
>
> ![](documentationPics/warning.png) Search only allows you to find words that contain exactly 
> the phrase, so do search carefully! Eg 'ice-cream' will not be returned if you search 'ice cream'!

<br/>

	Time breakdown: 
	1.0
	5.0
____________________________________________________________
```
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) `shortest-time` allows you to find the shortest time from one country to 
> another! If you wish to find or research on costs instead, do take a look at our shortest cost function 
> at [`shortest-cost`](#213-finding-the-least-cost-shortest-cost).

<br/>

### 2.13. Finding the least cost: `shortest-cost`

	150.0
	400.0
____________________________________________________________
```
> ![](documentationPics/tip.png) `shortest-cost` allows you to find the least cost from one country to
> another! If you wish to find or research in terms of flight time instead, do take a look at our 
> time function instead at [`shortest-time`](#212-finding-the-shortest-time-shortest-time).

<br/>

### 2.14. Exiting the program: `exit`
The **exit** command exits Traveller.

## 3. FAQ
This section contains a list of commonly asked questions about Traveller. If you are facing problems using Traveller, 
you may look through this section to see if it provides you with a solution. If not, you are always welcomed to email
the Traveller team at traveller@gmail.com.

**Q**: Why does Traveller keep exiting when I run it?

**A**: Traveller only exits when its data files *time.txt* and *cost.txt* are tampered with. Please check
if the files have been changed and re-download them from our 
[release.](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/releases)

> ![](documentationPics/warning.png) With the release of V2.1, both data files have been integrated into our executable jar file. 
> If you have modified them, do ensure that it follows how the files are read 
[here](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-w13-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#6-instructions-for-manual-testing).

<br/>

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Transfer the entire folder containing the items listed below to the other computer. 
   * *Traveller.jar*
   * *save* folder with *save.txt* inside.

<br/>

**Q**: Why does it keep saying "Country 'X' doesn't exist!"?

**A**: Traveller can only read specific words as countries.
Please check [here](#4-supported-countries-summary) for all supported destinations and their specific 
wordings.

If the problem persists, then your data in *time.txt* or *cost.txt* may have been corrupted.
Download a new copy of Traveller from [this link](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-1/tp/releases) to get a new
uncorrupted version of our jar file.

> ![](documentationPics/warning.png) With the release of v2.1, *time.txt* and *cost.txt* have been directly integrated 
> into our jar file, and should be not changeable.

<br/>

**Q**: What should I do when creating a new trip if my trip span multiple countries?

**A**: As of our current version v2.1, we unfortunately do not support multiple countries in 1 trip.
However, you can create multiple trips instead, 1 for each country that you plan to go to, and plan your trips from 
there.

<br/>

**Q**: What unit is time measured in?

**A**: Time is given in hours.

<br/>

**Q**: How do I interpret path and time shown in the `view` command?

**A**: Path can be read from left to right. For example, a path of `[SIN, MLY, SKR]` means that the shortest path from
Singapore (SIN) to South Korea (SKR) is to take a flight from Singapore to Malaysia (MLY), and then taking a flight from 
Malaysia to South Korea.

Similarly, time can be read from left to right. Continuing from the above example, if a time of `[1, 5]` is 
shown, this means that the flight from Singapore to Malaysia is 1 hour long, and the flight from Malaysia to South Korea
is 5 hours long.

<br/>
