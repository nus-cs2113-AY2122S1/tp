## **1. Terminology**

***Calorie*** - Calorie is a unit used to measure the energy of an item. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. On average, a male will require approximately 2500 cal consumed
from food per day while a female will require around 2000 cal intake per day.\
\
***Calorie goal*** - The calorie goal is defined as the amount of calories you wish to achieve per day. It calculated by subtracting the calories you burnt naturally and physically per day from your calorie intake. 
If you are planning to lose weight, it is recommended to set your daily calorie goal as a negative value and if you are planning to gain weight, it is recommended to set your daily calorie goal as
a positive value calorie goal.

***Net Calorie*** - Net calorie is the difference between calorie goal and the total calories burnt from exercising and
[body metabolism](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Metabolism.aspx).
For your information, we use [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) to compute
the rate of calories consumed by body metabolic activity.\
\
***Activity factor*** - Activity factor is a measure of the level of activity. This value is used in the calculation of BMR. In our application,
we use an integer ranged from 1 to 5 to measure the activity factor:
- *Integer 1*: Little to no exercise (0-1 day of exercises a week)
- *Integer 2*: Lightly active (1-3 days of exercises a week)
- *Integer 3*: Moderately active (3-5 days of exercises a week)
- *Integer 4*: Very active (6-7 days of exercises a week)
- *Integer 5*: Extremely active (when sports is your passion and have a very physical job scope)

***Body Mass Index (BMI)*** - A measure to evaluate if the body weight is healthy. BMI is computed by using the body
weight (in kg) divided by the square of the body height (in m). \
\
***Item*** - We use the term _Item_ to represent the items that can be stored in _Fitbot_. The available items
are _Food Item_ and _Exercise Item_.\
\
***Upcoming Exercise*** - We define the exercise with date after today's date as an Upcoming Exercise. This kind of exercise
will be handled specifically. It will not be added to the Exercise List but will be saved internally in the storage file. More
details of the process can be found [here](#442-adding-recurring-exercise-items-add-r).\
\
***Item Bank*** - The Item Bank is an item storage that is capable of storing the Food or Exercise Item with its respective calories. This is
to help you to store the calorie intake of a specific Food Item or the calories burnt from a specific Exercise Item for future use. More details
on how to add item into the Item Bank can be found [here](#451-adding-food-bank-items-add-fbank).\
\
***Parameters*** - Parameters are values in the command format that _Fitbot_ expects you to provide. For example, `height` and `weight`
are parameters used to obtain your body height and weight values.\
\
***Prefix*** - Prefix is used to help _Fitbot_ identifies the corresponding parameters you provided. For example, to allow _Fitbot_
to save your body height and weight, prefixes `h/` and `w/` are used. More details about how to use the prefixes in each
command can be found [here](#4-features).

### **4.2 Recording Your Food Consumption**

You can record all the Food Items consumed within a week into the Food List. This allows you
to keep track of your food calorie consumption and gain a better understanding of your diet habits. 

#### 4.2.1 Adding Food Items `add f/`

You can record Food Items consumed on a specific date and time with a specific calorie value into the Food List. 
This command allows you to add a new Food Item to the Food List. Repeated Food Items on the same day and time is supported too.

Format: `add f/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY} {t/HHMM}` adds a Food Item consumed with its respective calories on the given
date (`DD-MM-YYYY`) and time (`HHMM`).

‚ùó The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must be within the past 7 days (including today). For example, if today's date is `07-11-2021`, then the input
date must be within `01-11-2021` to `07-11-2021`. ([more details](#6-data-limits))


Example:
```text
add f/chicken rice c/607 d/04-11-2021 t/1400
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
	chicken rice (607 cal) @ 14:00, 04 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí° **Tip:** If you do not specify the date and time of the Food Item, it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

üí° **Tip:** It is possible to add Food Item without providing the calories of it. You can do this by saving the corresponding 
Food Item into the Food Bank. More details can be found [here](#45-building-your-food-bank).



#### 4.2.2 Viewing Food List `view f/`

You may want to view what Food Items you have consumed and how many calories you have taken in this week. This command will show 
the list of Food Items and their calories that you have added within the past 7 days (including today) into the Food List.

Format: `view f/`

Example: 

```text
view f/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here is a summary of all the food items you have consumed in the past week:
..........................................................................................................
You have consumed 3 food item(s) on Thursday (04 Nov 2021):

Total number of food consumed in this week: 7
Total calories consumed in this week: 3425 cal
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.2.3 Deleting Food Items `delete f/`

If you have accidentally added a wrong Food Item inside your Food List, there is no need to worry! This command allows you to 
remove a specific Food Item in the Food List.

Format: `delete f/LIST_NO d/DD-MM-YYYY t/HHMM` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Food Item in the Food List which has the date (`DD-MM-YYYY`)
and time (`HHMM`), where *n* is the index of the Food to delete.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.


Example:

```text
delete f/1 d/04-11-2021 t/1000
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been deleted:
	donut x2 (607 cal) @ 10:00, 04 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí°  **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Food Items from the list, there is a shortcut command: `delete f/all`.
```
delete f/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All food items have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
[‚è´ Back to content page](#content-page)

### **4.3 Recording Your Exercises**

Besides Food Items, you may also record exercises that you have done into the Exercise List. This will allow you to keep
track of total calories burnt and check whether you have done sufficient exercises. 

#### 4.3.1 Adding Exercise Items `add e/`

By using this command, you can add any Exercise Items done into the Exercise List. Repeated exercises on the same day is supported too.

Format: `add e/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY}` adds an Exercise Item with its respective calories burnt on the given date
(`DD-MM-YYYY`).

‚ÑπÔ∏è If the date `DD-MM-YYYY` provided is in the future, this exercise will be treated as an Upcoming Exercise Item, 
and it will be added to the [Upcoming Exercise List](#441-adding-upcoming-exercise-items-add-e) instead.

‚ùó The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must be within the past 7 days (including today). For example, if today's date is `07-11-2021`, then the input
date must be within `01-11-2021` to `07-11-2021`. ([more details](#6-data-limits))

Example:

```text
add e/hiit c/290 d/07-11-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been added:
	hiit (290 cal) @ 07 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

üí° **Tip:** Similar to [Food Item](#421-adding-food-items-add-f), if you do not specify the date and time of the Exercise Item,
it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

üí° **Tip:** It is possible to add Exercise Item without providing the calories burnt from it. You can do this by saving the corresponding
Exercise Item into the Exercise Bank. More details can be found at [here](#46-building-your-exercise-bank).

#### 4.3.2 Viewing Exercise Items `view e/`

It is possible to view and check all the exercises you have added. This command is for you to view all the exercises that you have done 
and their calories within the past 7 days (including today) in the list.

Format: `view e/`

Example: 

```text
view e/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here is a summary of all the exercises you have done in the past week:
..........................................................................................................
You have done 1 exercise(s) on Wednesday (03 Nov 2021):
	1. 5km run (500 cal)
Total calories burnt in the day: 500 cal
..........................................................................................................
You have done 1 exercise(s) on Friday (05 Nov 2021):
	1. biking (500 cal)
Total calories burnt in the day: 500 cal
..........................................................................................................
You have done 2 exercise(s) on Sunday (07 Nov 2021):
	1. training (200 cal)
	2. hiit (290 cal)
Total calories burnt in the day: 490 cal
..........................................................................................................
Total exercises done in this week: 4
Total calories burnt in this week: 1490 cal
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è It is also possible to view all the Upcoming Exercise Items from the Upcoming Exercise List that you have added before. More
details can be found [here](#443-viewing-upcoming-exercise-items-view-u).

#### 4.3.3 Deleting Exercises `delete e/`

In case you have added the wrong exercise, this command allows you to remove any exercise from the Exercise List.

Format: `delete e/LIST_NO d/DD-MM-YYYY` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Exercise Item in the Exercise List which contains the date (`DD-MM-YYYY`),
where *n* is the index of the exercise to delete.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete e/1 d/05-11-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been deleted:
	biking (500 cal) @ 05 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

üí°   **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Exercise Items from the Exercise List, there is a shortcut command: `delete e/all`.

```
delete e/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All exercise items have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### **4.4 Scheduling Your Exercises**

Besides your current exercises, you may also record all your Upcoming Exercise Items that you plan to do into the Upcoming Exercise List. 
This will allow you to plan your exercises in advance and be more aware of your calorie output from your exercises in the near future.

‚ÑπÔ∏è All of your upcoming Exercise Items will be automatically loaded into the Exercise List if the dates of the upcoming Exercise Items have passed.

#### 4.4.1 Adding Upcoming Exercise Items `add e/`

By adding an Exercise Item with a future date, your exercise will be treated as an Upcoming Exercise Item and gets added into the Upcoming Exercise List.

Format:`add e/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY}` adds an Upcoming Exercise Item with its respective calories burnt on the given date (`DD-MM-YYYY`}.


‚ùóÔ∏è The date `DD-MM-YYYY` provided must be in the future. Otherwise, if it is within the past 7 days (including today), it will be
  added to the [Exercise List](#431-adding-exercise-items-add-e) instead.\
‚ùó The date `DD-MM-YYYY` can only be within a year from tomorrow as any exercises beyond a year is too far into the future. ([more details](#6-data-limits))
 
Example:
```text
add e/hiit c/290 d/01-01-2022
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item for the future has been added:
	hiit (290 cal) @ 01 Jan 2022
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```



#### 4.4.2 Adding Recurring Exercise Items `add r/`

It is possible to schedule exercises that you do on a regular basis. By using this command, you can conveniently add recurring exercises
into the Upcoming Exercise List. This can be particularly useful if you have weekly trainings to record!

Format: `add r/ITEM c/CALORIES :/START_DATE -/END_DATE @/DAY_OF_THE_WEEK {,DAY_OF_THE_WEEK,...}` adds recurring exercises with its respective calories burnt to the Upcoming Exercise List. 
You may specify which day(s) of the week by providing multiple `DAY_OF_THE_WEEK` that are separated by commas.

‚ùó `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must be in the future.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` must be before `END_DATE`.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` must follow `DD-MM-YYYY` format.\
‚ùó `START_DATE` and `END_DATE` can only be within a year from today as any exercises beyond a year is too far into the future.\
‚ùó `DAY_OF_THE_WEEK` must be an integer between 1 and 7, representing Monday to Sunday respectively.


Example:
```text
add r/running c/200 :/01-12-2021 -/30-12-2021 @/1,4
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Recurring exercise item for the future has been added!
You can view your upcoming exercises by typing "view u/"!
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.4.3 Viewing Upcoming Exercise Items `view u/`

In order to view all of your Upcoming Exercise Items, this command can be used and all of your scheduled exercises and their calories 
will be displayed for you to see.

Format: `view u/`

Example:
```text
view u/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You have 10 upcoming exercise(s):
	1. running (200 cal) (Thursday 02 Dec 2021)
	2. running (200 cal) (Monday 06 Dec 2021)
	3. running (200 cal) (Thursday 09 Dec 2021)
	4. running (200 cal) (Monday 13 Dec 2021)

	9. running (200 cal) (Thursday 30 Dec 2021)
	10. hiit (290 cal) (Saturday 01 Jan 2022)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.4.4 Editing Upcoming Exercise Items `edit u/`

If you would like to make some changes to the details of your Upcoming Exercise Items, this command can be used and your Upcoming Exercise Items
in the Upcoming Exercise List will be updated.

Format: `edit u/LIST_NO {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES} {d/NEW_DATE}` edits the *n<sup>th</sup>* item in the Upcoming Exercise List, where *n* is the index of the Exercise to edit.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.\
‚ùó Though the parameters are optional, do provide at least one of them so that _Fitbot_ knows what you want to update about the Item!


Example:
```text
edit u/1 c/150 d/30-11-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Item number 1 in upcoming exercises has been changed to:
	running (150 cal) @ 30 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.4.5 Deleting Upcoming Exercise Items `delete u/`

In case any Upcoming Exercise Item is cancelled and you would like to remove it from the Upcoming Exercise List, you can use 
this command to delete that particular Upcoming Exercise Item. Deletion of multiple Upcoming Exercise Items is supported too. 

Format: `delete u/LIST_NO {,LIST_NO,...}` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Upcoming Exercise Item in the Upcoming Exercise List, where *n* is the index of the exercise to delete.
You may delete multiple Exercise Items at once by providing multiple `LIST_NO` that are separated by commas.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete u/1,2
__________________________________________________________________________________________
All of the following upcoming exercises have been deleted:
	1. running (150 cal) (Tuesday 30 Nov 2021)
	2. running (200 cal) (Monday 06 Dec 2021)
Number of upcoming exercise(s) left: 8
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```
üí°   **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Exercise Items from the Upcoming Exercise List, there is a shortcut command: `delete u/all`.
```
delete u/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All upcoming exercise items have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### **4.5. Building your Food Bank**
Do you have certain dishes or snacks that you frequently consume? Instead of having to key in their calories everytime you want to
record them into the Food List, you can add it into the Food Bank once so that the next time you want to record this item in the Food List,
you would only have to provide the name of the item!

#### 4.5.1 Adding Food Bank Items `add fbank/`
You can add a Food Item into the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `add fbank/ITEM c/CALORIES`

Example:
```
add fbank/McSpicy Meal c/1081 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added to the food bank:
	McSpicy Meal (1081 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

‚ùóÔ∏è The Food Bank cannot have duplicate item names as _Fitbot_ needs to be able to uniquely identify the item calories. Note that
the match for item name is **case-insensitive**. For example, if an item named `potato` already exists in the Food Bank, an item named `POTATO` also cannot be added in.

After adding the item to the Food Bank, you can now add the item into the Food List whenever you want without specifying the calories. 
Simply provide the name of the item and _Fitbot_ will search up the corresponding calorie value for the item with the same name for you from the Food Bank! As before, note that the matching of names is 
**case-insensitive**.

Example:
```
add f/mcspicy meal d/07-11-2021 t/1536
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
	mcspicy meal (1081 cal) @ 15:36, 07 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.5.2 Viewing Food Bank `view fbank/`
You can view all the Items in the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `view fbank/`

Example:
```
view fbank/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You have 2 food(s) in your food bank:
	1. Baked Potato (300 cal)
	2. McSpicy Meal (1081 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.5.3 Editing Food Bank Items `edit fbank/`
If you have entered any wrong information or wish to update existing Items in the Food Bank, you can use this command to do so.

Format:  `edit fbank/LIST_NO {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES}` edits the *n<sup>th</sup>* Item in the Food Bank, where *n* is the index of the Food Item to edit.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.\
‚ùó Though the parameters are optional, do provide at least one of them so that _Fitbot_ knows what you want to update about the Item!

Example:
```
edit fbank/1 c/350
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Item number 1 in the food bank has been changed to:
	Baked Potato (350 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.5.4 Deleting Food Bank Items `delete fbank/`
You can delete an Item from the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `edit fbank/LIST_NO {,LIST_NO,...}` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Item in the Food Bank, where *n* is the index of the Food Item to edit. 
You may delete multiple Food Items at once by providing multiple `LIST_NO` that are separated by commas.  

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete fbank/1,2
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All of the following food bank items have been deleted:
	1. Baked Potato (350 cal) 
	2. McSpicy Meal (1001 cal) 
Number of food item(s) left in the food bank: 0
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

üí°   **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Food Items from the Food Bank, there is a shortcut command: `delete fbank/all`.
```
delete fbank/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All food items in the food bank have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### **4.6. Building your Exercise Bank**
Have a standard workout routine that you use? You can add it into the Exercise Bank for _Fitbot_ to remember the amount of calories you 
burn from it!


#### 4.6.1 Adding Exercise Bank Items `add ebank/`
You can add an Exercise Item into the Exercise Bank using this command.

Format: `add ebank/ITEM c/CALORIES`

Example:
```
add ebank/30 min jog c/450
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been added to the exercise bank:
	30 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

‚ùóÔ∏è The Exercise Bank cannot have duplicate item names as _Fitbot_ needs to be able to uniquely identify the item calories. Note that
the match for item name is **case-insensitive**. For example, if an item named `jogging` already exists in the Exercise Bank, an item named `Jogging` also cannot be added in.

Similar to the Food Bank, after adding the item to the Exercise Bank, the next time you want to add this item to your Exercise List, you can just provide its name
and _Fitbot_ will search up the corresponding calorie value for the item with the same name for you from the Exercise Bank! As before, note that the matching of names is
**case-insensitive**.

Example:
```
add e/30 Min Jog d/07-11-2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been added:
	30 Min Jog (450 cal) @ 07 Nov 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.6.2 Viewing Exercise Bank `view ebank/`
You can view all the Items in the Exercise Bank using this command.


Format: `view ebank/`

Example:
```
view ebank/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You have 1 exercise(s) in your exercise bank:
	1. 30 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```


#### 4.6.3 Editing Exercise Bank Items `edit ebank/`
If you have entered any wrong information or wish to update existing Items in the Exercise Bank, you can use this command to do so.

Format:  `edit ebank/LIST_NO {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES}` edits the *n<sup>th</sup>* Item in the Exercise Bank, where *n* is the index of the Exercise Item to edit.

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.\
‚ùó Though the parameters are optional, do provide at least one of them so that _Fitbot_ knows what you want to update about the Item!


Example:
``` 
edit ebank/1 n/35 min jog
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Item number 1 in the exercise bank has been changed to:
	35 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```


#### 4.6.4 Deleting Exercise Bank Items `delete ebank/`
You can delete an Item from the Exercise Bank using this command.

Format: `delete ebank/LIST_NO {,LIST_NO,...}` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Item in the Exercise Bank, where *n* is the index of the Exercise Item to edit.
You may delete multiple Exercise Items at once by providing multiple `LIST_NO` that are separated by commas.  

‚ùó `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete ebank/1
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been deleted from the exercise bank:
	35 min jog (450 cal)
Number of exercise item(s) left in the exercise bank: 0
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

üí°   **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Exercise Items from the Exercise Bank, there is a shortcut command: `delete ebank/all`.
```
delete ebank/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All exercise items in the exercise bank have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### **5. Data Management**


#### 5.1. Saving The Data

There is no need to save manually. Any updates made to the data will be automatically stored into the local drive and reloaded when _Fitbot_ is restarted.

#### 5.2 Editing The Data File

_Fitbot_ data files are saved as `.txt` files `<Fitbot.jar file location>/data/<text file name>.txt`. \
Advanced users are welcomed to update data directly by editing the data files. 

‚ùó If your changes to the data files format are invalid, _Fitbot_ will skip the wrongly formatted line when it loads in the data.

‚ùó Ensure that you quit _Fitbot_ first if you would like to edit the files. Edits made directly to files when _Fitbot_ is running will not be saved.

### **7. FAQ**

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?\
**A:** Zip the folder with _Fitbot_ and its data files, and transfer to the new computer. Extract the zipped folder onto your new computer and follow steps 1, 4 and 5 in [Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to get your _Fitbot_ running on your new computer.

**Q:** How many profiles can I create?\
**A:** _Fitbot_ only supports 1 profile. If you need to make any changes to your current profile, you can refer to [Updating Profile Attributes](#413-updating-profile-attributes).

**Q:** How can I reset _Fitbot_ and its data?\
**A:** You can reset _Fitbot_ by deleting the data folder in the same directory as the `Fitbot.jar` file location. If you choose to remove
only selected `.txt` files, data in the remaining files will still be loaded and viewed in _Fitbot_.
