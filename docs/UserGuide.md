## 1. Introduction

Welcome to your all-in-one desktop app for managing modules, tracking your food consumption, time scheduling, journaling, and CAP planning!
We know that you are a Computing student here at NUS 👨‍🎓 and may prefer typing ⌨ to swiping (Hello Vim! 😉)
, so we think that our command line interface for cramming & knowledge (Click) is a great fit for you!

This user guide serves to give you a brief overview of our features, as well as how to use them.

>**To use this guide effectively**
>
> We ordered the commands and features in ***sequential order*** for you,
> so some commands cannot work independently without using other commands first.
> If you want to follow our sequence, please enter every command given in the examples.
>
> An example of dependent commands is : you cannot add a lecture or zoom link without adding the specified module.
>
> Therefore, please follow the sequence from 3.0 on to 3.6!

Jump in to the section [2. Quick Start](#2-quick-start) to get started!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 2. Quick Start

* Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
* Download the latest `click.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.1).
* Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Click.
* In the home folder for Click, launch the `jar` file using the `java -jar click.jar` command on Command Prompt (for Windows) or Terminal (for Unix-based OS, such as macOS and Linux) to start the app. If the setup is correct, you should see the following:

```
	__________________________________________________
	 _____ _  _     _
	/  __ \ |(_)   | |
	| /  \/ |_  ___| | __
	| \__/\ | | (__|   <
	\_____/_|_|\___|_|\_\

	Hello! I'm Click
	What can I do for you?
	__________________________________________________
```


* Type the valid command into the terminal (or Command Prompt) and press <kbd>return</kbd> (or <kbd>Enter</kbd>) to run the command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3. Features

**Before you begin, please note the command format:**

- Words in `[UPPER_CASE]` are the parameters to be supplied by you.

- The `[INDEX]` used in various commands must be a number specifying the order of an item in the list of items.
  The smallest index would naturally be 1. (1-based)

- The `{}` wrapping indicates an optional parameter.

- Parameters cannot be reordered.
  Example: If the command specifies `module add c/[MODULE_CODE] n/[MODULE_NAME]`, keying in `module add n/[MODULE_NAME] c/[MODULE_CODE]` will result in an invalid command.

> **NOTE**:
> We left out some expected commands for readability as they will print out similar messages

### 3.0 Getting Help
Click helps you by showing all available commands and syntax

Format: `help`

You can refer  to [Command Summary](#4-command-summary) for a TLDR version.

> - The supported expected grades are: `A+`, `A`, `A-`, `B+`, `B`, `B-`, `C+`, `C`, `D+`, `D`, `F`, `CS`, `CU`, `NA`. Specifying the expected grade other than the supported grades will cause an error.
> - The default values of module name, modular credits, and expected grades are `None`, `4`, and `NA`, respectively.
> - The modular credit must be a positive integer.
> - The module code must not be empty.

### 3.5 Managing your food consumption

Sometimes you snack, maybe go for supper breaks now and then.

Click provides you with the ability to track your food consumption to
match your dieting needs to consume the recommended amount of calories
you need every day!

#### 3.5.1 Adding a food item: `food add`

Allows you to add a food item and calorie count

Format: `food add n/[FOOD_NAME] d/[KCALORIE] {d/[DATE]}`

For instance, imagine you've just had a nice meal at McDonald's after
a three-hour-long lecture. You feel guilty about having so much fast food.
However, how do you quantify your guilty-ness? Simply tell Click what you've
eaten and how many calories are included, so you can see how far you should run
to burn them away!

>**NOTE** :
> If you leave the date parameter empty, Click would just add in today's date for you, no worries!


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Example:

```
food add n/Samurai Burger c/433 
food add n/Seaweed Shaker Fries Seasoning c/15

## 5. Frequently Asked Questions

We know you are a curious individual, so here
are the answers to some frequently asked questions about Click.

Can I use Click on different operating systems such as Windows and macOS?
>Yes. Click is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux as long as you have Java 11 or above installed in your machine.

What will happen to my data if Click crashes when I'm using my laptop? My battery life is pretty bad.
>Data is saved automatically to `STORAGEFILE` whenever you change your tasks. Therefore, your data will be safely saved even though Click is crashed.

Can I exit Click without using the bye command? I recently learnt shortcuts  such as <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> and <kbd>Alt-F4</kbd> and would rather
forcefully exit the app.
> Yes, you can. As mentioned above, your data will be saved automatically if a change of the tasks occurs, so you can exit Click worry-free.

This app seems to replicate what I'm currently  doing on paper, such as writing my tasks on a physical calendar,
and recording my calorie count on a journal. I'd like to  know some  benefits of  this over paper.
>  Sure, while we acknowledge your  love of pen and paper we'd like to remind you the scalability of digital apps,
>  preservation of data as well as  the efficiency of the CLI in typing rather than writing.

What if my data is corrupted in the text files?
> Not to worry, the app would still be functional.
> However, new files would be created to replace the corrupted text files.
> This would mean that your previous data is irrecoverable.
> The developer team is working on undo and redo features for our future implenentation to better
> serve your needs.
