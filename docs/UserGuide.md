# User Guide

## Introduction

The Smart Inventory Tracking and Updating System (SITUS) is a **desktop app for tracking
ingredient inventory designed for restaurant/ F&B inventory managers.** 

Have you ever found yourself tired of clicking buttons endlessly when adding or removing items from your current 
inventory-tracking software? Would you much rather type a single line command to achieve the same things a long-winded GUI 
could do? 

**If so, SITUS is for you!**

SITUS allows you to not only track the stock of your ingredients but also their expiry dates, 
search for ingredients by name or expiry date, and even set and receive alerts when stocks they are running low or reaching expiry.

This user guide will give you a quick rundown of all the things SITUS can do for you and how you can use these tools effortlessly.  

### How to use this guide
There are 4 main sections in this guide, [Quick Start](#1-quick-start), [Features](#2-features), [FAQ](#3-faq), 
and [Command Summary](#4-command-summary). All of these are included in [Contents](#contents) for your convenience. 

[Quick Start](#1-quick-start) provides you with a short tutorial on how to get SITUS set up correctly on your own device.
[Features](#2-features) are split into different subsections for each of SITUS' commands. They all have the same structure:
1. A brief description of what you can do with the command
2. The format of the command and an explanation of its user-defined parameters if it requires any (more on user-defined 
parameters [here](#format-notes))
   * If there are user-defined parameters, examples of possible commands are also given  
3. Expected outputs from SITUS after running the command

[FAQ](#3-faq) answers some possible questions you may have getting started with SITUS. [Command Summary](#4-command-summary)
provides a table summarising all SITUS commands and their formats for your quick reference.

#### Format notes
* All SITUS commands are case-insensitive. Hence, if you enter `carrot`, `Carrot`, or even `caRRoT` as part of commands, they are 
read as the same word by SITUS
* Words/phrases in this format: `example`, are command snippets
* Words/phrases within square brackets `[square bracket]` are user's (your) inputs. <br>
  For example, in `delete [INGREDIENT_NUMBER]`, `INGREDIENT_NUMBER` is the user's input,
  such as `delete 1`.
  > Note: Ensure *ALL* parameters are specified when entering the command. There are no optional parameters for commands
  > apart from [the `date` command](#211-view-set-current-date).
* All information about ingredients expiring in **x** days is calculated based on the current date of the system.

____________________________________________________
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2. Add Ingredients

You can add an ingredient to the ingredient list to start tracking it.

Command: `add n/[INGREDIENT_NAME] a/[AMOUNT] e/[EXPIRY]`

The parameters used in the command are:
* `INGREDIENT_NAME`: the ingredient name to add
* `AMOUNT`: the ingredient amount to be added, in kilograms.
* `EXPIRY`: the expiration date of ingredient, in format of `dd/mm/yyyy`.

Examples: `add n/carrot a/20 e/01/03/2022`, `add n/potato a/5 e/25/12/2021`

Outputs:
```
add n/carrot a/20 e/01/03/2022
____________________________________________________
Got it. This ingredient has been added to the inventory:
    Carrot | Amount Left: 20.000 kg | Expiry Date: 01/03/2022
Current inventory has 1 items.
This ingredient will expire in 131 days.
____________________________________________________
```
```
add n/potato a/5 e/25/12/2021
____________________________________________________
Got it. This ingredient has been added to the inventory:
    Potato | Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
Current inventory has 2 items.
This ingredient will expire in 65 days.
____________________________________________________
```

> Note: It is important you name your ingredients either **ALL** singular or **ALL** plural to avoid adding both `Carrot` and 
> `Carrots` as separate ingredients, as SITUS only looks for an exact match when grouping ingredients by name (more on this
> grouping will be explained in the next section).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.3. List Ingredients

You can view the full list of your ingredients that SITUS is currently tracking. The list shows your ingredients in groups. 
These groups are ingredients of the same name (e.g. `Carrot` or `Potato`), and within each group are the different expiry
dates of certain amounts of that ingredient. For example in the output shown below, it shows that there are 20 kg of the 
ingredient `Carrot`, and all 20 kg are expiring on 01/03/2022.  

Command: `list`

Output:
```
list
____________________________________________________
Here is the list of the ingredients currently in inventory:
    1. Carrot | Total Amount: 20.000 kg
        1.1. Amount Left: 20.000 kg | Expiry Date: 01/03/2022

    2. Potato | Total Amount: 5.000 kg
        2.1. Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 25/12/2021
____________________________________________________
```

> Note: You are recommended to use `list` before most of SITUS's commands as many of them require the index of the 
> ingredients (the numbers before each ingredient in the list, such as 1.1 or 2.1).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.4. Update Ingredients

You can update the amount of an ingredient in your ingredient list if it needs
changes.

Command: `update [GROUP_INDEX.INGREDIENT_INDEX] a/[AMOUNT]`

The parameters used in the command are:
* `GROUP_INDEX`: the index of the group the ingredient to be updated is in
* `INGREDIENT_INDEX` : the index within the group of the ingredient to be updated
* `AMOUNT`: the ingredient amount to be updated, in kilograms

Example: `update 1.1 a/100`

Output (using list shown in the [list section](#23-list-ingredients)):
```
update 1.1 a/100
____________________________________________________
Got it. This ingredient has been updated:
    Carrot | Amount Left: 100.000 kg | Expiry Date: 01/03/2022
____________________________________________________
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.5. Subtract Ingredient Stock

You can subtract a given amount from an ingredient's total amount if you have used/ sold that amount. If the amount 
given is equal to the existing stock of the ingredient, the ingredient is automatically removed from the list (instead 
of displaying zero stock for the item.)
> Note: If the ingredient has multiple entries, the earliest expiring one will be deducted first, as a good practice for inventory management.

Command: `subtract n/[NAME] a/[AMOUNT]`

The parameters used in the command are:

* `NAME`: the name of the ingredient group to subtract from
* `AMOUNT`: the ingredient amount to be subtracted, in kilograms

Example: `subtract n/carrot a/50`

Output (using list shown in the [list section](#23-list-ingredients)):

```
subtract n/carrot a/50
____________________________________________________
Got it. 50.0 kg has been subtracted from Carrot
____________________________________________________
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.6. Delete Ingredients

You can delete an ingredient from the ingredient list based on its name and expiry date in the list if you wish to stop 
tracking it (e.g. if that batch has expired).

Command: `delete [GROUP_INDEX.INGREDIENT_INDEX]`

The parameter used in the command are:
* `GROUP_INDEX`: the index of the group the ingredient to delete is in
* `INGREDIENT_INDEX` : the index of the ingredient to update within its group

Example: `delete 1.1`

Output (using list shown in the [list section](#23-list-ingredients)):
```
delete 1.1
____________________________________________________
Got it. This ingredient has been removed:
    Carrot | Amount Left: 50.000 kg | Expiry Date: 01/03/2022
____________________________________________________
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.7. Search Ingredients By Expiry

You can search for ingredients that will expire by a specified date instead of looking through the full list for them. 
The ingredients expiring sooner are shown at the top. Expired ingredients are also shown for your action.

Command: `expire [DATE]`

The parameter used in the command is:
* `DATE`: the date of interest, in the format of `dd/mm/yyyy`.

Example: `expire 26/12/2022`

This is the current list: 
```
list
____________________________________________________
Here is the list of the ingredients currently in inventory:
    1. Carrot | Total Amount: 2.000 kg
        1.1. Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 11/11/2021

    2. Plum | Total Amount: 7.000 kg
        2.1. Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
        2.2. Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021

    3. Pumpkin | Total Amount: 7.000 kg
        3.1. Amount Left: 6.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
        3.2. Amount Left: 1.000 kg | Expiry Date: 21/11/2021
____________________________________________________

```

Output:
```
expire 13/11/2021
____________________________________________________
There are 4 ingredients expiring by: 13/11/2021
    Plum | Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
    Pumpkin | Amount Left: 6.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
    Carrot | Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 11/11/2021
    Plum | Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
____________________________________________________
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.8. Search Ingredients By Name

You can search for ingredients using keywords in their names to find specific ingredients without looking through the
full list.

Command: `find [INGREDIENT_NAMES]`
* `INGREDIENT_NAMES`: the words to search for in the ingredient list. 
One or more ingredient names can be entered. Separate them using *spaces*.
> Note: these names are case-insensitive, so the query `carrot` will give results that may not be exact matches, such as `Carrot`.

Examples: `find radish`, `find potato tomato`

Outputs (using list shown in [Section 2.7](#27-search-ingredients-by-expiry):
```
find carrot
____________________________________________________
I found these ingredients for "carrot":
    1. Carrot | Total Amount: 2.000 kg
        1.1. Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 11/11/2021
____________________________________________________
```
```
find plum pumpkin
____________________________________________________
I found these ingredients for "plum":
    2. Plum | Total Amount: 7.000 kg
        2.1. Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
        2.2. Amount Left: 5.000 kg | Expiry Date: 12/11/2021
I found these ingredients for "pumpkin":
    3. Pumpkin | Total Amount: 7.000 kg
        3.1. Amount Left: 6.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021
        3.2. Amount Left: 1.000 kg | Expiry Date: 21/11/2021
____________________________________________________
```
> Note: The output also gives the actual index of the ingredients in the full ingredient list. This is hence useful if you 
> need the index of an ingredient (e.g. to `delete` or `update` it) but have too many ingredients to manually find it using `list`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.9. Display Alerts

You can view the different types of alerts to see which ingredients are running low on stock or expiring.

Command: `alerts [ALERT_TYPE]`

There are 3 possible `[ALERT_TYPE]`:
1. `expiry`: displays all ingredients expiring within the *number of days* as specified by the threshold, with ingredients expiring sooner/that have expired shown first.
2. `stock`: displays all ingredients with stock lower than the threshold value
3. `all`: displays both of the above

Output (using list shown in [Section 2.7](#27-search-ingredients-by-expiry)):
```
alerts expiry
____________________________________________________
There are 3 ingredients expiring by: 11/11/2021
    Plum | Amount Left: 2.000 kg | Expiry Date: 06/11/2021

Command: `set [TYPE] [NEW_VALUE]`

The parameters used in the command are:
* `TYPE`: either `expiry` or `stock`
* `NEW_VALUE`: the new threshold for which alerts will be displayed (in days for `expiry` and kilograms for `stock`)

Examples: `set expiry 30`, `set stock 4.0`
