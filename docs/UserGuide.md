## Introduction

TermiNUS is a CLI (command line interface) program for NUS students who wish to consolidate their
NUS academic needs such as schedules, questions and notes for the modules that they are taking.
With TermiNUS, it aims to aid students and improve their learning experiences while studying in NUS.

### Purpose of this Guide

This documents aims to provide you with instruction on how to use `TermiNUS` and tips & tricks
included to improve your experiences while using it. The document is for both beginners and advanced
users. The document will bring you through the installation process and guide you on all 
the commands available within `TerminNUS`.

Terminologies used throughout this guide:

| Terminology | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| workspace |  A workspace is the environment in which you are currently assessing. For example, when you want to access some files inside a folder, you will need to enter the folder first. As such the folder is a **workspace**.|
|workspace indicator|A workspace indicator shows the current workspace you are currently in when using `TermiNUS`. For example, in the expected output for commands, you will be able to see `[] >>>` which means you are in the **default workspace**, `[module] >>>` which means you are in the **module management workspace**. etc.|
|default workspace|The very first workspace when executing the `TermiNUS` program. For example, `[] >>>` indicates you are currently in the **default workspace**.|
|module|A module refers to a NUS module. For example, `CS2113T` is a module.|

## Getting Started

This section will detail the `TermiNUS` installation guide, as well a quick guide on how to use 
`TermiNUS`.

### Installing TermiNUS

1. Ensure that you
   have [Java 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) or
   above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `TermiNUS.jar`
   [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T10-2/tp/releases/).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use for `TermiNUS`.
    1. This is because `TermiNUS` will store all its saved data in the folder it is currently in.
4. Open your command prompt and go into the folder containing the `TermiNUS.jar` file.
    1. You can do so by `win + R` and run `cmd`.
    2. Next, a console will appear, type in the following `cd C:/folder` where `folder` is the
       folder containing the `TermiNUS.jar` file.
5. Next to run `TermiNUS`, in the command prompt type in `java -jar TermiNUS.jar`.
6. When you first start the `TermiNUS`, you will be greeted with our banner:

    ```
    Welcome to TermiNUS!
    You have no schedule for today.
    
    Type any of the following to get started:
    > exit
    > help
    > module
    > go
    > timetable
    
    [] >>>  
    ```

7. For more information of each command, please refer to the [Features](#section-managing-all-your-modules) below.

### Quick Guide of TermiNUS

1. Before adding any **note**, **schedule** and **question**, we will need to have a **module** first in which these items belong to.
2. You can do so by adding a module within the **module management workspace**.  
   Please refer to: [Section: Managing all your Modules](#section-managing-all-your-modules).
3. After adding a module, you can proceed to add items such as **note**, **schedule** and **question** into it.
4. But firstly you will need to enter the **module workspace** in which you have just created.  
   Please refer to: [Section: Specific Module](#section-specific-module).
5. Once entering the **module workspace**, you can add the items related to the module here.
    1. Please refer to [Section: Note](#section-note) for any related **Note** item.
    2. Please refer to [Section: Schedule](#section-schedule) for any related **Schedule** item.
    3. Please refer to [Section: Question](#section-question) for any related **Question** item.
6. Once you are done, you can exit **TermiNUS** using the `exit` command.

Hope you enjoy your experience with TermiNUS!

## Command Syntax

> 💡 Commands are **case-insensitive**, but the `value` you provide can be **case-sensitive**.   
> Commands may also **ignore unnecessary data** appended behind commands.
> 
> Example: <code>HELP &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> is a valid command, and the spaces after `HELP` 
> will be ignored.

As you use this guide, you will notice commands with specific brackets around some values such as `{}` and `<>`.

The below table represents what each means.

| Command options | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `{value}` |  The value is optional, and including it may provide different results.|
| `<value>` | The value is required for the command to work properly.|
|`"<value>"`| Some command have `""` quotes in it, this is required for the command to work properly. For example, `add "<value>"` would need to be `add "something"`.|
|`index`|A number identifying an item in TermiNUS. This index can only be viewed using the `view` command.|
|`start_time`|The `start time` must be in a **HH:mm** format which follows the **24-hour notation**. For example, `14:20` is valid which represents `2:20 pm`.|
|`day`|The `day` must be a day spelled out fully and is case-insensitive. For example, `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday` and `Sunday` are the only **7** valid days.|
|`duration`|The `duration` must be a **positive** integer and upon addition with `start_time`, it must not exceed the 24-hour limit of the day. For example, if `start_time` is `21:00`, `2` is a valid `duration` but `-1` and `4` are not.|
|`valid_file_name`|Any value that has the tag `valid file name` cannot be empty, cannot have more than **30** characters and can only contains [ASCII](https://www.asciitable.com/) characters **between the dec value of 32 and 126 inclusive** with the **exception** of `/`, `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, `\0`, `\f`, `'`, `?`, `*`, `\ `, `<`, `>`, `"`, `:`, `.` , <code>&#124;</code> |

## Displaying all schedules across all modules

**Format:** `timetable {day}`

Displays all schedules from all modules in TermiNUS or displays certain schedules that falls on the
specified day.

> ⚠️The `<day>` must be a valid **day spelled fully**. For example, `monday` is a valid day but 
> `mon` is not.
> 
> You may view [Adding a Schedule](#adding-a-schedule) for the valid list of days.

> 💡 The accepted input for the `<day>` argument includes "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", and "Sunday".


Example 1: `timetable`

```
[] >>> timetable
THURSDAY:
1. CS2113T Tutorial 1 (Thursday, 10:00 - 12:00): https://zoom.us/test
FRIDAY:
1. CS2113T Lab 1 (Friday, 12:30 - 14:30): https://zoom.us/test

[] >>> 
```

Example 2: `timetable thursday`

Expected Output 2:

```
[] >>> timetable thursday
1. CS2113T Tutorial 1 (Thursday, 10:00 - 12:00): https://zoom.us/test

## Advanced Usage of Commands

**Format:** `<workspace> <available workspace command>`

> 💡 Beginner users are not advised to use this advance usage of commands until they are more familiar with the commands provided by TermiNUS. 

Advanced users can access workspace command directly without entering its environment in order to speed up the process of using TermiNUS. Seen below are some
command examples.

A workspace command is a command that will bring you to its own workspace. Current workspace command
includes note, schedule, question, and module.

> 💡 To access the module in TermiNUS, you will need to use the `go` command. For more information, 
> please refer to [Section: Specific Module](#section-specific-module).

> ⚠️This advance command do not allow any chaining with the `back` command.

Example:

- Adding a note without entering the note workspace.

```
[CS2113T] >>> note add "Advance command"  "Advance command is cool"
Your note on 'Advance command' has been added!
[CS2113T] >>> 
```

- Adding a schedule without entering the schedule workspace.

```
[CS2113T] >>> schedule add "Lecture" "Friday" "16:00" "2" "https://zoom.us/test"
Your schedule on 'Lecture' has been added!
[CS2113T] >>> 
```

- Adding a question without entering the module workspace.

```
[] >>> go CS2113T question add "What is Java?" "It is a programming language."
Your question on 'What is Java?' has been added!
[] >>> 
```

## FAQ
**Q:** Can I edit the information in the`data` directory?  
**A:** Yes! **TermiNUS** saves and loads your information from the `data` folder. You are able to edit the files
in the `data` folder. We recommend you to update the **contents** of any notes which should be a `.txt` file in the 
`data/module_code` directory. However, we **do not** recommend modifying any configuration file such as `.json` file 
or renaming any folders in the `data` folder including the `data` folder itself. For these, you should use **TermiNUS** instead to edit.

**Q:** (Windows) What will happen if I create a new module when I have an existing folder with the same module code in the `data` directory?  
**A:** Regardless of **case sensitivity** (i.e. `cS2113T` or `CS2113T`), the files within the folder will be deleted.

**Q:** (MacOS/Linux) What will happen if I create a new module when I have an existing folder with the same module code in the `data` directory?  
**A:** Only the files within the **uppercase** folder (i.e. `CS2113T`) will be deleted. If there are folders with mixed or
lowercase (i.e. `cS2113t` or `cs2113t`), the **content within will be ignored** (for loading, saving and deleting).

**Q:** Why is my module folder in the `data` folder not deleted?  
**A:** There can be 2 reason. Firstly, there are files inside the folder that are locked by the 
operating system. This means there might be other applications using the file, which is preventing 
TermiNUS from deleting the folder cleanly. Usually restarting the computer and deleting it will 
solve the issue. Secondly, if you are running macOS or Linux, we do not delete folders that are 
**not uppercase** (e.g. `CS2113T` will be deleted but `CS2113t` will not be).

**Q:** What will happen if my data is **not loaded properly** when entering TermiNUS?  
**A:** Any existing data may be **overwritten** in the `data` folder when you perform any command within this state. If you do encounter this error, please copy the `json` file as soon as possible before exiting TermiNUS to prevent any loss of data.

**Q:** Why will storage be disabled?  
**A:** This is to **avoid a loss of data** when there is an error with loading or saving data into the `data` folder. Hence, if an error occurs, all storage operations will cease to work only until you exit the program where TermiNUS will attempt to save your data one last time.
