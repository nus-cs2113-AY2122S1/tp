### Search items
Search items by ID, Title, Status, and Category.

For searching by ID, the ID given by the search input must be exactly the same as the ID in database, 
that is, it is **case-sensitive**, and any difference in space or special characters is not allowed.

For searching by Status, the Status given by the search input must be one of "AVAILABLE", "LOANED" or "RESERVED".
It is **case-insensitive**.

For searching by Category, the Category given by the search input must be one of "Book", "Audio", "Video", "Magazine", or "Misc".
It is **case-insensitive**.

For searching by Title, the Title given by the search input only needs to partially match the title stored in database.
It is **case-insensitive** as well.

Any items matching more than one keyword will be listed. 
Items matching more searching criteria will be listed at a higher position.
Items matching fewer searching criteria will be listed at a lower position.

Format: Subset of `search i/ID t/TITLE s/STATUS c/CATEGORY`

##### Usage Example: 

`search s/loaned c/book`

Searches the catalogue for items with the property of "loaned" and "book". 
An item that is both loaned and is a book will be listed at the top.
An item that is loaned but not a book, or an item that is a book but not loaned is also listed at a lower position.
An item that is neither loaned nor a book will not be in the search result.

##### Expected Output:
```
  (+) Here are the searching results in library
  ========================================
  [B] 43 | LOANED (Chuan Kai TILL 25-11-2021) | The Three Body Problem | Liu Cixin
  [A] A A | LOANED (Silin TILL 30-12-2021) | Thriller | Michael Jackson | 2h
  [B] 123 | AVAILABLE | Harry Potter | JK Rowling
  ========================================
```

In the sample output, "The Three Body Problem" is both loaned and a book, matching both of the criteria, it is listed first;
"Thriller" is loaned but not a book, "Harry Potter" is a book but not loaned, they satisfy only one criterion, therefore they are listed at a lower position.
The rest of items do not match any search keyword, and they are not listed.

### Reserve items

##### Usage Example: 

`res i/2551 u/johnsmith`

##### Expected Output:
```
> res i/2551 u/johnsmith
  (+) You have successfully reserved an item:
  [B] 2551 | RESERVED (johnsmith) | To Kill a Mockingbird | Harper Lee

title and author simultaneously using `edit 123 t/NEW TITLE a/NEW AUTHOR`. 

> ℹ️ Attributes cannot be changed to the same existing attribute.<br>
e.g. If the title of an existing book with ID 123 is already `Harry Potter`, calling `edit 123 t/Harry Potter` will 
> throw a warning. 

> ℹ️ Trying to change the id of the item into an id that is already associated with another existing item in the

### Exit the program
Exit the program.

##### Usage Example:

`exit`

##### Expected Output:
```
> exit
See you soon!
```

## Data Storage

Upon starting the program, it will search for the presence of a file in the directory `./data/data.json`. This is a file on the disk that tracks the last recorded state of the catalogue.
- If the file exists, `libmgr` will attempt to read and parse all information within to load into the catalogue before completing the startup process
- If the file does not exist, `libmgr` will create a new file with an empty catalogue
- If the file exists, but the content is malformed or corrupted, users will be warned. Any commands input by the user after startup will result in the file being wiped with a new empty catalogue.

> ℹ️ Data is updated at the completion of execution of each command entered by the user

> ⚠️ While the `data.json` file can be edited manually, it is highly recommended that users **do not** attempt to do so unnecessarily

> ⚠️ **Do not** make changes to the `data.json` while `libmgr` is running. Any changes made while running will not be reflected by `libmgr` and such changes may be overwritten.

## FAQ

**Q**: What platforms are `Libmgr` supported on?

**A**: This application supports cross-platform operation, as long as Java has been properly configured.

**Q**: Can I port the program over to other devices

**A**: Yes, just copy over the `libmgr.jar` along with the `./data/data.json` files to the target computer, and make sure that they are stored within the same folder, all data will be preserved

**Q**: Can I manually edit the `data.json` file to change contents of the catalogue

**A**: While it is possible for users to manually edit the data using tools such as text editors, we highly recommend against doing so, as the risk of corrupting the file or entering malformed input is very high.
When `libmgr` detects errors or corruptions in `data.json` it will overwrite the existing catalogue with a new, empty one.
