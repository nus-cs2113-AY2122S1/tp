## Features:
### Notes:
#### Notes about command format:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g. the `CARD_INDEX` in `delete CARD_INDEX` is a parameter that user should provide, such as `delete 1`.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken. e.g. if you specified `delete 1 2` then it will be recognized as `delete 1` and delete the first card for you.

#### Notes about game levels in CodeHunt:
* There are 2 levels of games you can try in CodeHunt: `Easy mode`, `Difficult mode`
![mode](images/mode.png)
    * The 2 game levels contain the same games with different game content.
    * Player can choose the game level they want to challenge.
* Different game levels have different rules:
    * For `Easy mode`: Whether you win the game or not, you can choose to enter next game by choosing `continue`, or try
      this game one more time by choosing `again`, or you can exit CodeHunt and save your game records by choosing `exit`
![choice](images/choice.png)
    * For `Difficult mode`: Only when you win the game, you can go on to enter the next game, otherwise you will have to retry the 
      game by choosing `again` until you win, or you can exit CodeHunt by choosing `exit`.
* Win cards by winning the games
    * Every time you win a game, you will collect a card with some coding knowledge on it. You can use the cards to learn new things or buy tips in the following games.
