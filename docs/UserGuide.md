## Features

### Notes about the command format:

* Words in UPPER_CASE are arguments to be supplied by the user.  
e.g. in `history -g GAME_MODE`, `GAME_MODE` is an argument which can be used as `history -g time`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.  
e.g. `-g GAME_MODE [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS]` can be used as `-g time -n 9` or as `-g time`
* Parameters can be in any order.  
e.g. if command specifies `history -g GAME_MODE [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS]`, `history [-n NUMBER_OF_RECORDS] -g GAME_MODE`  
is also acceptable.  
Note: One parameter is defined as the option e.g. `-g` and its value (if there is such a field) e.g. `time`
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, 
only the first occurrence of the parameter will be taken  
e.g. if you specify `history -g time -g time -n 10`, only `history -g time -n 10` will be taken. 
* For commands which have a `-h` parameter, if `-h` is among the parameters provided, all other parameters will be 
ignored and the guide for that command will be displayed.    
e.g `history -g time -h -n 10` will be interpreted as `history -h`.
* All parameters which do not conform to the command syntax will be ignored.  
e.g.2 `clear -gtime` will be interpreted as `clear`
