## Setup

This section details how you can install a working cOOPer on your desktop.

1. Download the latest version of cOOPer [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/releases).
2. Copy the JAR (.jar) file to an **empty** folder of your choice. This folder will be used as the *home folder* for your cOOPer application.
3. If you are using Windows, [launch the Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/open-command-prompt-in-a-folder-5185505)
   in the home folder. If you are using Mac or Linux, [open a Terminal window](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20Terminal%20window%20from%20within%20a%20folder%20in,window%20to%20the%20selected%20folder.) 
   in the home folder.
4. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed or your desktop.
   1. In the Command Prompt / Terminal, enter `java -version`.
   2. You should see the following on the Command Prompt / Terminal:
   ![javaVersion.png](userGuideImages/javaVersion.png)
   3. The section enclosed in red shows the version you currently have installed.
   4. If nothing appeared on the Command Prompt / Terminal, it most likely means you do not have Java installed on your computer. Do not worry, you can download it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html).
5. Run cOOPer by entering `java -jar cOOPer.jar`.
6. A greeting from cOOPer should appear as such:

```
            /$$$$$$   /$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$
           /$$__  $$ /$$__  $$| $$__  $$
  /$$$$$$$| $$  \ $$| $$  \ $$| $$  \ $$ /$$$$$$   /$$$$$$
 /$$_____/| $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$$$$$$//$$__  $$ /$$__  $$
| $$      | $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$____/| $$$$$$$$| $$  \__/
| $$      | $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$     | $$_____/| $$
|  $$$$$$$|  $$$$$$/|  $$$$$$/| $$     |  $$$$$$$| $$
 \_______/ \______/  \______/ |__/      \_______/|__/

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## cOOPer's Commands

‚ÑπÔ∏èHere are some things to note about cOOPer's **commands**.<br>

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not have parameters (e.g. `exit`, `meetings`, `cf`, `help`, etc.) will be **ignored**. For example, `exit 123` will be interpreted as `exit`.<br>
- For commands having parameters, extra characters added to the back of the command **will be considered as part of the command parameter** too, and this may lead to the parameter **not being interpreted correctly** by cOOPer. For example, if `available 08-11-2021 14:00 abc` is entered, cOOPer interprets the parameter as `08-11-2021 14:00 abc` which according to cOOPer is an invalid time.<br>
- cOOPer does not accept **empty** parameters.
- All commands are **case-insensitive**. For example, `list` is the same as `List` or `LIST`.<br>
- **Empty** input (e.g. simply pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, entering whitespaces or <kbd>Tab</kbd> characters) will be ignored and cOOPer will continue prompting you for your next command.<br>

‚ÑπÔ∏èHere is some additional information about cOOPer's **command prompt**.<br>

- At different stages of using cOOPer, an additional label which looks like `[label]` will appear beside the prompt.<br> 
- There are **three** types of labels you will see:
  - `[Logged out]` indicates you are currently **logged out** of cOOPer
  - `[Balance Sheet]` indicates you are using cOOPer's **[balance sheet](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add) function**
  - `[Cash Flow]` indicates you are using cOOPer's **[cash flow](#creating-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--add) function**
- No label shown indicates you are **logged in** to cOOPer, but you are using **neither** the balance sheet function nor the cash flow statement function.
- While using the balance sheet / cash flow statement functions, you may exit the function at any time by entering any other command. For example, a command related to cOOPer's meetings or forum features.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Getting Started

This section explains how you can register an account with cOOPer in order to gain access to cOOPer's features.

### How cOOPer is to be used
- The **correct** way (as of v2.1) to use cOOPer is to run cOOPer on a **single** desktop with only **a single user** interacting with cOOPer at a time.
> ‚ö†Ô∏ècOOPer's features **will not work** as described in this user guide if **multiple users** are interacting with cOOPer on **multiple desktops** at the same time.

### Roles
- There are two main roles you can hold as a user of cOOPer, namely the _**admin**_ role or the _**employee**_ role.

- You may choose to hold the admin role if you hold a management position in the startup. e.g. Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Human Resources Manager (HR), accountant etc.

- On the other hand, you may hold the employee role if you are a working employee at the startup.

- cOOPer offers tailor-made functions and features specific to your role to ensure the correct level of administrative access within the company throughout cOOPer's usage.

### Registration
- Upon first-time use of cOOPer, ensure that all members of the startup are registered with the correct role.

- Once a member has been registered, they will be able to log in to cOOPer to access its features.

- How to register:
  1. When you see the `[Logged out]` label beside cOOPer's prompt, enter `register [username] /pw [password] /as [role]`. 
  2. Upon successful registration, you should see a message informing you of your successful registration.
  3. You can now log in to access cOOPer's features specific to your role. Refer to the [Logging In](#logging-in-login) section to find out more about logging in.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`[username]` refers to your name, `[password]` refers to your password, while `[role]` refers to your role as determined [here](#roles).

- Example input:

```
>> [Logged out] register Sebastian /pw 123 /as admin
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
Sebastian is now successfully registered as an admin!
=========================================================================
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èA similar output should be observed when an employee is registered, with the output now showing 'employee' instead of 'admin'.<br>
> üí° Just like when you use any other app with a sign in feature, remember to record down your username and password somewhere (e.g. Sticky Notes, a password manager).<br>

  1. When you see the `[Logged out]` label beside cOOPer's prompt, enter `login [username] /pw [password] /as [role]`.
  2. You should see a message informing you of your successful login. The `[Logged out]` label is no longer present beside the prompt.
  3. You now have access to cOOPer's features specific to your role.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`[username]`, `[password]` and `[role]` refer to your name, password and role as registered in cOOPer's system.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èThe username you are logging in with is **case-sensitive**. For example, logging in with the username `sebastian` is not the same as logging in with `Sebastian`.

- Example input:

```
>> [Logged out] login Sebastian /pw 123 /as admin
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
You are now logged in successfully as Sebastian!
=========================================================================
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏ècOOPer treats `[amount]` as positive and `[amount]` enclosed in parentheses as negative.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èAll **assets** are positive, hence no parentheses are needed, while all **liabilities** are negative, hence parentheses are needed. **Shareholder's equity** can be either positive or negative, hence parentheses are optional. To see which fields belong where, see the example output of the[`list`](#viewing-the-balance-sheet-bs--list) feature.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èAny entries **more than** 300 Million SGD (positive or negative) will **not** be added.<br>
> üí°   Remember to enter `bs` before entering `add` or cOOPer will not know which financial statement to add to.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èEntering `bs` and `add` after the balance sheet is complete will **overwrite** the current fields of the balance sheet one by one, updating the current draft of the balance sheet. Hence, it is important to add the balance sheet fields to **completion**. <br>

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èThe check can only inform you if the statement does or does not tally, and not which entry is incorrect as that comes down to human error.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Any scalar values more than or equal to 1 Billion SGD (positive or negative) will be displayed as such, and not as their exact values.

- Example input:

```
>> [Balance Sheet] list
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`list` displays the current draft of the cash flow statement. <br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èEntering `list` at any time will display any overwritten fields from the current draft of the cash flow statement, and any non-overwritten fields from the previous draft .<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èAny scalar values more than or equal to 1 Billion SGD (positive or negative) will be displayed as such, and not as their exact values.

- Example input:

```
>> [Cash Flow] list
```

- Expected output:

```

### Projecting cash flow: `proj`
- Generates projections on your company's 'Free Cash Flow' (FCF).
- How to generate a projection:
  1. [Fill up the cash flow statement](#creating-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--add) with last year's FCF.
  2. Enter `proj [years]` to project your company's FCF marginal growth Year-Over-Year (YoY) by the number of `[years]` specified. 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èFCF is the last field of the cash flow statement.

- Example input for a projection of three years:

```
>> proj 3
```

- Expected output for a Free Cash Flow of 3500, at a growth rate of 16.67% for three years:

```
=========================================================================
At your current rate of profitability growth in Free Cash Flow, these are 
future year's projections:
1 year: 4083
2 year: 4763

### Generating a PDF from the financial statement : `generate`
- Creates a Portable Document Format (PDF) file from the current draft of the financial statement specified (balance sheet or cash flow statement).
- How to generate the PDF file:
  1. Enter `generate [financialStatement]` where `[financialStatement]` is one of `bs` or `cf`.
  2. If **successful**, the PDF file is created in a folder named 'output' in the _home folder_ with the name of the financial statement you generated. For example, `generate cf` will create a PDF named 'CashFlowStatement'.
  
- Example input for successful generation of the cash flow statement PDF:

```
>> generate cf
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
The PDF file has been successfully generated!
=========================================================================
```

- The diagram below shows where you can find the generated PDF file.

<p align="center">
    <img width="500" src="userGuideImages/generateCfOutput.png" alt="CfOutputPdf"><br>
</p> 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èYou **do not** need to be currently using the balance sheet function or the cash flow statement function in order to use this feature. <br>
> üí°   Always [**fill up** the balance sheet](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add) / [cash flow statement](#creating-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--add) first before generating it as a PDF.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èAs of v2.1, `generate` is only able to create **one** document for a financial statement. Entering `generate` more than one time overwrites the existing PDF with the current draft of the financial statement.<br>
> 
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**
> - The creation of the PDF document requires an **active internet connection**. 
> - In the event that there is no internet connection, a backup '.txt' file will be created in the same 'output' folder in which the PDF was supposed to be created.
> - The contents of the backup '.txt' file created can be used to recreate the PDF document with the use of an [online LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/). <br>
>
> üí° **Always** ensure that you have an active Internet connection before using the `generate` command.

### Scheduling meetings with different users: `schedule`
- Schedules meetings either **automatically** or **manually**. 
- **Automatically** scheduling a meeting means cOOPer will pick the **earliest timing** all specified users and yourself are available at, and schedules a meeting then. 
- How to **automatically** schedule a meeting:
  1. Enter `schedule [meetingName] /with [username1], [username2]`.
  2. If successful, cOOPer will create a new meeting at that time. Otherwise, cOOPer will inform you that no meeting can be scheduled with the specified users.

- **Manually** scheduling a meeting means cOOPer goes to the timing you specified and checks if all specified users and yourself are available, and schedules a meeting then.
- How to **manually** schedule a meeting:
  1. Enter `schedule [meetingName] /with [username1], [username2] /at [date] [time]`.
  2. If successful, cOOPer will create a new meeting at that time. Otherwise, cOOPer will inform you that no meeting can be scheduled with all the users at that specified time.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èYou do not have to enter your own `[username]` as cOOPer assumes you are in the meeting that you want to schedule. <br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èThere is no limit to the number of `[username]`s you can enter. cOOPer supports scheduling a meeting with a large number of users. However, a large number of users may **slow** cOOPer down.<br>
> üí°   Before you do a manual schedule, you may want to check the [`availability`](#viewing-which-users-are-available-at-different-timings-availability) table for better success rates.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è`[date]` has a format of **dd-MM-yyyy**, similar to the format [`available`](#declaring-available-timing-for-meetings-available) uses. Any other format will **not** be accepted and will result in incorrect behaviour.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è`[time]` has a format of **HH:mm**, in *24-hour clock*, similar to the format [`available`](#declaring-available-timing-for-meetings-available) uses. Any other format will **not** be accepted and may result in incorrect behaviour.


- Example input for **automatically** scheduling a meeting:

```
>> schedule PR /with Eugene
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
Success!
You have scheduled a <<PR>> meeting at 08-11-2021 10:00 
with attendees: Eugene, Sebastian
=========================================================================
```

- Example input for **manually** scheduling a meeting:

```
>> schedule PR /with Eugene /at 08-11-2021 14:00
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
Success!
You have scheduled a <<PR>> meeting at 08-11-2021 14:00 
with attendees: Eugene, Sebastian
=========================================================================
```
