# ConTech User Guide

## Introduction

**ConTech** (pronounced as Contact) is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing computing-related 
contacts**. Specially designed to be optimised for use on the CLI, **ConTech** allows you to seamlessly **add**, **edit**, 
**view**, **list**, **search**, and **import** your contacts.

If you are a computing professional that often uses the command line for work, **ConTech** can get your contact 
management tasks done faster than any traditional GUI app. 

This guide serves to introduce our various [features](#features) such as `add`, `edit`, `view`, and other commands, 
and guide you to easily manage your **ConTech** Book. 

**ConTech** aims to improve your efficiency at work, be it by cutting down the time required to look up for various 
usernames when working with colleagues, or by importing hundreds of contacts with just one simple command.
<br/>

## How to use the User Guide

To make full use of the user guide, we have provided a table of contents with their hyperlinks. This would allow you 
to quickly access portions of the guide you require. 

However, for first time users, you are highly encouraged to go through the user guide in order, from the top to 
bottom. This is because the guide is also written in a specific order to allow you to maximise your understanding 
when learning how to use **ConTech**.

## Quick Start

This section aims to get you started with using **ConTech**. 

1. Ensure that you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest version of `contech.jar` from **[here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-T09-1/tp/releases)**.
3. Copy the `contech.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for **ConTech**.
4. Open your desired _Command Line Interface_ from the folder with `contech.jar` and enter the following code: 
`java -jar contech.jar`.
5. As a first time user, you would be required to type in your personal details.
6. Type a command in the command box and press _Enter_ to execute it. e.g., typing `help` and pressing _Enter_ will 
   display the help message. <br>
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `add -n Alex Lee -g alexlee -e alex.lee@contech.sg -te alexl33`: Adds a contact named `Alex Lee` 
     to the ConTech Book.
   * `ls`: Lists all contacts.
   * `view 1`: Displays all the details of the contact at index `1`.   
   * `rm 1`: Deletes the contact at index `1` in the list.
   * `exit`: Exits the program.
    
If you have reached this step without any issues, congratulations! You have successfully set up **ConTech**.

>:information_source: You are advised to go through the following two sections.
>Before moving on to the features of **ConTech**, we have prepared some documentation regarding some common 
**[notations](#notations)** that will be used throughout this guide. You are strongly recommended to familiarise yourself 
with the notations used.

You may also refer to the **[features](#features)** below for details of each feature and 
its respective command.

<a name="flag"></a>
### Contact flags: `-flag`
When using commands such as `add`,`edit` and `search`, you can specify details with the use of flags in the form: 
`-flag`.

**ConTech** currently supports six `flags` and has in built checkers to check if the format of the `details` are 
fulfilled. These `flags` include:
- `-n`: for your contact's name
- `-g`: for your contact's GitHub account username
- `-l`: for your contact's LinkedIn handle
- `-te`: for your contact's Telegram handle
- `-tw`: for your contact's Twitter handle
- `-e`: for your contact's email address

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<a name="notations"></a>
### Common notations used
Throughout the user guide, you will find the following notations:
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are meant to be parameters that you can supply to your commands.
  - e.g. When adding a contact, in the command `add -n NAME -g GITHUB`, `NAME` and `GITHUB` are parameters which you 
    can specify, such as `add -n Le Zong -g lezongmun`.
  - e.g. When viewing a contact's details, in the command `view INDEX`, `INDEX` is a number (integer) representing 
    your contact's index in the **ConTech** book which you can specify, such as `view 2`.
- Items in curly braces `{}` are optional.
- Items in angle braces `<>` are mandatory.
  - e.g. When specified in the format `<-n> <NAME> {-g <GITHUB>}`, it means that:
    - The `-n` flag and `NAME` detail are mandatory fields, without which the command would not execute.
    - The `-g` flag is optional, however, if used, a `GITHUB` detail would have to be specified.
- Items specified with a pipe `|` denote an either-or field.
  - e.g. For `{-n | -g | -l | -te | -tw | -e}`, only **up to** one `flag` is allowed, but there are **six** choices.

Do familiarise yourself with these notations to better utilise the user guide.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Transfer the files inside `data/` to a new directory `data/` in the same location as the jar file on the target
computer. The files are `data/contacts.txt` and `data/me.txt`.

**Q**: Can I edit the files in `data/` manually?

**A**: Yes, ConTech supports manual editing of `contacts.txt` and `me.txt` in the `data/` directory, although this is 
not recommended. When doing so, remember to follow the correct syntax for contact details. Any contacts with incomplete/
incorrect/corrupt data such as missing fields will be discarded by ConTech upon launch. In addition, extra fields 
will be ignored. As such, users are recommended to use the `add` and `edit` commands in the app instead of manually 
editing the save data files. For adding a large number of contacts at once, the `import` function can be used.

**Q**: Does ConTech support duplicate prevention?

**A**: Yes, ConTech has built-in duplicate protection for all commands except `import` currently. This will be added in
a future revision with more granular controls to allow users to easily handle multiple duplicate contacts when importing.
For more information on the implementation, please refer to the [Developer Guide](https://ay2122s1-cs2113t-t09-1.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html#ComingSoon).
