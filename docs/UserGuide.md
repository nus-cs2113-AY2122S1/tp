### Display graph of dish wastage : `graph dish`

    * To circumvent this limitation we have added a bar that has a digit instead of a `|` inside to indicate fractional units
      (e.g 4.5 units will have four bars followed by a bar that contains a 5). This is still only capable of representing up to one decimal place.

Example of usage:

`graph dish`

### Saving the data

Food-O-Rama data (*dish and ingredients list*) are saved automatically after any command that changes the data. There is
no need to save manually.

<br/>

### Accessing the data

Food-O-Rama data is saved as 2 files: *dishes.txt* and *ingredients.txt*. These files can be found in the *`data`*
folder in the same directory as the `Food-O-Rama.jar` file.

<br/>

### Manipulating the data

Food-O-Rama data can be written manually by editing the text files in the *`data`* folder. 

‚ùï *Tip*: Manual editing is **not recommended** unless you are sure of the changes that you are making. You may instead 
utilize the various `edit` commands in the program to edit your Dish and Ingredient data.

* üí° *Note*: `[WASTAGE_LIMIT]` is `-1` when no limit is set.

    * `[WASTAGE_LIMIT]` is `-1` when no limit is set.
    * `[EXPIRY_DATE]` follows the format `dd/MM/yyyy`.
    * `[EXPIRY_DATE]` is `null` when no expiry date is set.
