## Introduction

Decodex is a **Command Line Interface (CLI) application for Capture-The-Flag (CTF) players to perform [encoding](#terminologies), [decoding](#terminologies), [encryption](#terminologies) and [decryption](#terminologies) of data**, which come in the form of [modules](#terminologies) that can be **executed with ease** and **without any programming** needed. Decodex also provides [recipes](#terminologies) which can also be used to link several of these [modules](#terminologies) together so that they could be executed in one go to speed up repetitive tasks. The intuitive interaction can thus help to speed up a playerâ€™s performance during CTFs and save time without having to manually code the tedious [data transformations](#terminologies).

This guide serves to help you understand the usage of the program, which includes performing data transformations using [basic commands](#basic-commands) as well as developing and managing recipes using [recipe commands](#recipe-commands-recipe).

> :information_source: This user guide is tailor-made for CTF players who have some technical understanding of encoding schemes and cryptography.

## Features

> :exclamation: Notes about the commands and arguments:
> * Arguments enclosed in `<>` are **mandatory** arguments while arguments enclosed in `{}` are **optional** arguments. For example, `select <moduleName> {moduleArgument}` would mean that `moduleName` is mandatory while `moduleArgument` is optional.
> * Arguments must be entered in the **exact order and position** as specified in the commands' respective formats.
> * All commands and arguments are **case-sensitive**.
> * After the execution of a command, you may see a `[+]` , which means that it ran successfully or a `[x]`, which denotes that an error has occurred.

### Basic Commands

#### Help: `help`

Lists the syntax and descriptions of all available commands.

Format: `help`

Example:

![help.png](images/ug/help.png)

#### Input of Data: `input`

Stores the data to be processed by modules.

Format: `input <data>`

> :information_source: `data` will be treated as text.

Examples:

- `input HelloWorld!` Enters the plain-text `HelloWorld!` as data.
- `input SGVsbG9Xb3JsZA==` Enters the base64-encoded text `SGVsbG9Xb3JsZA==` as data.

![carbon(1).png](images/ug/inputCommandExample.png)

> :exclamation: Behaviour of the `input` command:
> * Note that the program will consider **all characters as data following the first space character** in the input command. You may observe leading and trailing whitespaces in the output.
> * **Non-printable characters** (e.g. null characters) may not be correctly displayed and could potentially scramble the user interface.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### List Available [Modules](#terminologies) or [Recipes](#terminologies): `list`

Shows a list of all available modules or recipes.

Format: `list {category}`

> :information_source: Notes about the `list` command:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### [Recipe](#terminologies) Commands: `recipe`

> :information_source: During the execution of the application, it would display the name of the recipe that is "currently being edited" (if any) in `[]` of the application's prompt. This currently edited recipe will be the target for some `recipe` commands such as [`recipe push`](#add-a-module-into-a-recipe-recipe-push), [`recipe pop`](#remove-a-module-from-a-recipe-recipe-pop) and [`recipe reset`](#clear-all-modules-in-a-recipe-recipe-reset).
> 
> ![carbon(17).png](images/carbon(17).png)

#### Create a New [Recipe](#terminologies): `recipe new`

Creates a new recipe and sets it as currently being edited.

Format: `recipe new <recipeName>`

> :information_source: `recipeName` can only contain alphabets, numbers and underscores.

Example:

- `recipe new testRecipe` Creates a new recipe with the name `testRecipe`.

![recipeNew.png](images/recipeNew.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Select a [Recipe](#terminologies) for Editing: `recipe select`

#### List [Modules](#terminologies) in a [Recipe](#terminologies): `recipe list`

Show all the modules in a recipe, in the order they were added.

Format: `recipe list {recipeName}`

> :information_source: When `recipeName` is not specified, modules from the recipe that is currently being edited will be listed instead.

Example:

- `recipe list testRecipe` Lists the modules in the recipe named `testRecipe`.

![recipeList.png](images/recipeList.png)

#### Add a [Module](#terminologies) into a [Recipe](#terminologies): `recipe push`

Adds a module into the recipe that is currently being edited.

Format: `recipe push <moduleName> {moduleArgument}`

Example:

- `recipe push base64encode` Adds the `base64encode` module into the current editing recipe.
- `recipe push rotencode 13` Adds the `rotencode` module with a single argument `13` into the current editing recipe.

![recipeDelete.png](images/recipeDelete.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage of Recipe Files

> :exclamation: Notes about the recipe files
> * A recipe will correspond to a recipe file which is a plaintext file with the name `<recipeName>.txt` where `recipeName` is the name of the recipe.
> * It is highly recommended that you only modify recipe files through the [`recipe`](#recipe-commands-recipe) commands in Decodex and not manually edit the recipe files.
> * If you choose to manually edit the recipe files, the correct format would be that each line in the respective recipe file should contain only one module, and they should be formatted in the following syntax of `<moduleName> {moduleArgument}`. You should also not be editing while Decodex is running as Decodex could accidentally overwrite your changes.
> * Incorrectly edited files will be considered as invalid and will not be loaded on program start up.
> * The recipe files would also not be loaded successfully if Decodex does not have access rights to the files, or it is not in the valid filetype.

#### Load Recipe Files on Startup

Loads the recipes from the recipe files found in the `recipe/` directory. This is done automatically for you on startup so that you do not have to manually add multiple recipe files into Decodex each time.

#### Save Recipe to File

Saves the recipe to a recipe file in the `recipe/` directory. This is done automatically for you whenever a recipe is created or modified so that it is more convenient and less punishing for you (especially if you often forget to save your documents before exiting).

#### Delete Recipe File

Deletes the recipe file in the `recipe/` directory. This is also done automatically for you (via the `recipe delete` command), so that you do not have to manually find the corresponding recipe file to delete it.
