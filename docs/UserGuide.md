# SLAM User Guide

Welcome to SLAM! SLAM is a desktop application for student group leaders in NUS to manage their group events,
tasks and members. This application allows you to effectively plan and manage the organisation of
events by allowing users to create and add such events to their schedule. Leading up to the actual date and time of the
event, committee heads can add tasks (e.g. meetings, purchase of logistics) to complete under each event to keep track
of progress. Group members can also be added and assigned to these tasks. This application uses a Command Line
Interface (CLI); that is, the application is operated by typing commands into a command prompt/terminal.

This user guide is written to assist you in making full use of SLAM's available list of functions and features so that you can manage your events, tasks, and members using SLAM the way it was designed to.

Key in your description and press `enter`, or just press `enter` if you have none. You have successfully added an event
into SLAM!
