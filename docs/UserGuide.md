## 2. Features 

### Notes:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you, the user.

  e.g. in add `a/AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be typed as `a/12.30`.


- Parameters surrounded with `[` and `]` are optional parameters which you might consider including to your input.
  e.g. in the show graph feature: `show_graph [Y/YEAR]`, an optional `YEAR` parameter may be added to show graphs of different years.


- Most features below have a collapsible section that allows you to see the run time output. Do check them out if you want to visualize what the product looks like!
e.g. in add `a/AMOUNT`, `AMOUNT` is a parameter which can be typed as `a/12.30`.


- Parameters can be in any order.
e.g. if the command specifies `c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT`, `a/AMOUNT c/CATEGORY` is also acceptable.


- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence 
of the parameter will be taken. e.g. if you gave `a/100 a/1000`, only `a/1000` will be read in.

### 2.5 Budget Setting

### Set budget: `set_budget`

This sets a budget limit for one of the many preset expense categories. 
Reminders will be given when your spending approaches the budget limit!
From here onwards, sub-budgets refer to the `food`, `transport`, `bills`, `medical`, `entertainment` and `misc` budgets.

To help you better manage your budgets, the following features are in place for setting budgets:
1. The new budget limit for each sub-budget must be greater than the current month's expenses for that sub-budget.
2. The sum of all the sub-budget limits must be less than the `overall` budget limit.
3. In the event that a sub-budget's expenses exceed its budget limit, the total expenses for that sub-budget will be used for the calculation in point 2 instead.

Example:

|                    | Food | Transport | Bills | Medical | Entertainment | Misc | Overall     |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------------- | ---- | -------     |
| **Expenses**       | $100 | **$1**    | $100  | $100    | $100          | $100 |             |
| **Budget Limit**   | $100 | $100      | $100  | $100    | $100          | $100 | **>$600**   |

In the example above, none of the sub-budget expenses exceed their budget limits. 
The allowable overall limit must be greater than $100 + **$100** + $100 + $100 + $100 + $100 = $600, which is the sum of all the sub-budget limits.


However, in the following example, the transport expense exceeds the transport budget.
The allowable overall limit must be greater than $100 + **$150** + $100 + $100 + $100 + $100 = $650.

|                    | Food | Transport | Bills | Medical | Entertainment | Misc | Overall     |
| ------------------ | ---- | --------- | ----- | ------- | ------------- | ---- | -------     |
| **Expenses**       | $100 | **$150**  | $100  | $100    | $100          | $100 |             |
| **Budget Limit**   | $100 | $100      | $100  | $100    | $100          | $100 | **>$650**   |

<br>

Format: `set_budget c/CATEGORY a/AMOUNT`

- `CATEGORY` has to be one of `food`, `transport`, `bills`, `medical`, `entertainment`, `misc` or `overall`. 
- `AMOUNT` must be more than or equal to 0.05.
- `AMOUNT` has to be less than 100,000,000,000 (100 Billion).
- `AMOUNT` has to be in 2 decimal places.

Examples:

- `set_budget c/bills a/100` Sets the `bills` budget to $100.

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
When command <code>set_budget c/bills a/100</code> is given, you get the following message if the budget is set successfully:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BILLS budget set to $100.00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</details>
<br>


### Check budget: `check_budget`

This checks the budget limit of one of the many preset expense categories.
Use this when you forget your budget limits!

Format: `check_budget c/CATEGORY`

- `CATEGORY` has to be one of `food`, `transport`, `bills`, `medical`, `entertainment`, `misc` or `overall`.

Examples:

- `check_budget c/bills` checks the budget limit of the `bills` budget.

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
When command <code>check_budget c/bills</code> is given, you get the following message:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current BILLS limit is $100.00
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</details>
<br>

### Set threshold: `set_threshold`

This sets the threshold beyond which reminders will be given when approaching the budget limit.

Format: `set_threshold t/THRESHOLD`

- `THRESHOLD` has to be a value between 0 and 1.
- Setting `THRESHOLD` to 0.9 produces reminders when you have used up more than 90% of your budget!

Examples:

- `set_threshold t/0.8` sets the threshold value of all budget categories to 80%.

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
When command <code>set_threshold t/0.8</code> is given, you get the following message:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Threshold for budget reminders set to 0.8
We'll warn you when you spend 80.0% of your budget!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</details>
<br>

### 2.6 Currency Conversion

### Set currency: `set_curr`

This allows you to see everything money-related in a different currency. Any money-related amount you key in from now 
onwards will be treated as the new currency set.

Format: `set_curr c/CURRENCY`

- As of v2.0, Stonks XD supports 2 different currencies: SGD and HKD.
- If you try to set currency to currency you're already using, a warning will be shown.

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
Let's take the following budget limit for <code>FOOD</code> expenses as an example:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current FOOD limit is $12.50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<br>
If you wish to convert the above (and all entries) to HKD, simply enter <code>set_curr c/HKD</code>. You will receive the following confirmation message:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All entries have been converted to HKD!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<br>
If we check our budget limit once again, we see that it has now been converted to the appropriate value in HKD!
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current FOOD limit is $62.50
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
<br>
To convert back to SGD, just enter <code>set_curr c/SGD</code> and all entries will revert back to their original denominations.
</details>
<br>

### Check current currency: `check_curr`

This shows you what currency setting you are currently on.

Format: `check_curr`

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
If you are unsure what currency your values are in, just enter <code>check_curr</code> and it will show the following message:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You currency setting currently: SGD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</details>
<br>

### List available currencies: `list_curr`

This shows you what currency setting you are currently on.

Format: `list_curr`

<details>
<summary> ▼ Expected output in run window </summary>
<br>
If you are unsure as to what currency types you can convert to, just enter <code>list_curr</code> and it will show the following message:
<pre>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here is a list of available currencies you can convert to!
1. HKD
2. SGD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
</details>
<br>

### 2.7 Graphing

### View yearly report: `show_graph`

This shows the monthly breakdown of the finances in a Yearly Report which also
includes current month spending and earnings and your overall account balance regardless of year.
We recommend using this function after your daily logging of expenses for a one-stop check-in on the state of your finances!


#### Note
1. The graph scales according to your largest monthly total, the scale currently used by the graph will be shown to you on the top right. 1.0E9 for example would mean 1,000,000,000, E stands for exponential.


2. It would be ideal not to have entries with big differences as the Stonks XD app is meant for daily logging.

Format: `show_graph [Y/YEAR]`

- `YEAR` is an optional input which you may include. It will show the graph that corresponds to the given year. It must be in the YYYY format

### 2.10 Saving of Data

### Saving of data

Stonks XD will save / load your data from `StonksXD_Entries.csv` and `StonksXD_Settings.csv`. This ensures that you 
will not lose important data when Stonks XD closes.

The 2 `csv` files will be stored in the same directory as `StonksXD.jar`.

`StonksXD_Entries.csv` is an editable file. It stores the following content:
1. `Expense` entries.
2. `Income` entries.

`StonksXD_Settings.csv` a **read-only file**. It stores all the important settings:
1. Currency setting.
2. Threshold setting.
3. Budget settings for different expense categories.

All important fields will be separated by a `,`.

The reason for data files being in `.csv` format is for you can have an easier time editing / viewing the data 
in Excel when **not** using the program. It is easy to make mistakes when editing the `.csv` files manually so 
do be careful.

<br>

#### When editing / viewing csv files

- `.csv` files **must not** be open concurrently while Stonks XD is running. In other words, never have two programs 
writing / reading the `.csv` files at the same time. This will very likely cause saving / loading errors and 
loss of data.


- `StonksXD_Settings.csv` is **read-only**. This is because changing the settings will result in many unexpected
  results. For example, changing the currency setting in the file would result in the amounts in `StonksXD_Entries.csv`
  being recognised as another currency.


- Restrictions and rules for different variables are the same as how you would enter them in the Command Line 
Interface, as specified above.


- Do not alter / delete the headers of `.csv` files. Stonks XD is able to minimise the damage if you do so but to 
ensure your data is saved / loaded properly, please do not edit anything unexpected.


- Stonks XD expects the dates in `StonksXD_Entries.csv` to be in `DD/MM/YYYY` format i.e., `11/12/2021` when loading 
data. When opening `StonksXD_Entries.csv` in Excel, Excel might change the format of the dates. Do ensure Excel's date 
format is in `DD/MM/YYYY` when dealing with `StonksXD_Entries.csv`. Entries with a different date format will be 
considered corrupted and will not be loaded into Stonks XD.

  
- Do not edit the amount of your entries **drastically** such that they exceed the max amount per entry or the 
total limit of 100,000,000,000 for expenses / incomes. Entries that cause you to exceed either of the 2 limit will be 
considered corrupted and not be loaded.

<br>

#### In the event of corrupted data

When you run Stonks XD, it will immediately start to load all the data from both `.csv` files. You might run into 
messages telling you that there are corrupted data, and they will not be loaded. This is likely because you have 
edited things you are not suppose to, or you have edited wrongly. There is a way to minimise this damage (This is 
optional, and you do not have to do this if you are fine with losing data). 
Here are the steps:
1. When you have terminated Stonks XD but want to edit the `.csv` files, make a copy of them first.


2. If you run Stonks XD and receive corruption errors, end the program.


3. Copy and paste the contents from your copies back into `StonksXD_Entries.csv` and `StonksXD_Settings.csv`. This 
means all your edits are gone. But, this will ensure that there will be no data is lost. 


---

## 3. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Your data is saved in 2 `.csv` files called `StonksXD_Entries.csv` and `StonksXD_Budget.csv`. To transfer the data, make a copy of these files and paste them in the same directory as the `.jar` file on your new machine. 

**Q**: What if my program terminates unexpectedly?

**A**: All data will be stored inside the respective `.csv` files.
