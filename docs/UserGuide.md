## 3.0 FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A**: Locate text file named `mTracker.txt` and transfer the file over to another computer.

**Q**: Can I edit the data without launching the mTracker? 

**A**: You can open the `mTracker.txt` file located in the same directory as the jar file
to edit/add instruments manually. However, please make sure that each line
contains details of only one instrument.

**Q**: Can I add multiple instruments in one command?

**A**: No, most commands are designed to handle one instrument at a time. As with most commands,
the add feature only allows adding of 1 instrument at a time.
