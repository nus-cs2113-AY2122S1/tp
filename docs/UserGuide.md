# User Guide

## What is CCA Manager?

CCA Manager is a **simple and easy to use** organisational planner for CCAs (Co-Curricular Activities) in NUS. It is 
designed specifically for students who are key appointment holders of such CCAs. Features include **storing and tracking
of information** on CCA members, training schedules and attendance records which can be accessed quickly via a Command
Line Interface (CLI). CCA Manager aims to **centralise and optimize** all CCA-related information, so that you can focus on
improving other aspects of the CCA.

## Purpose of this User Guide

This user guide will help you get started on using **CCA Manager**. [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites---things-to-prepare-before-you-start-using-cca-manager) will show you how to 
set up CCA Manager on your computer. The [Commands](#commands) section will show you the list of commands and how to use
them. Finally, [Command Summary](#command-summary) provides you with an overview of all the commands you can execute.

## Commands

**CCA Manager** helps you to organize three main types of information: [Members], [Training] and [Attendance].
With **CCA Manager**, you can organize your data with the help of useful commands such as `add`, `delete`, `edit`, `list` and `find` function

### Quick Reference: | [Member Commands](#member-commands) | [Training Commands](#trianing-commands) | [Attendance Commands](#attendance-commands)

## Warning Labels
⚠️ *denotes important formatting points you should pay attention to. Failing to follow them will cause your command to be unsuccessful.*


## Member Commands
Members of CCA will be added using the `add` member command. The key information needed for a member will be the member's name, student number, gender and phone number. It is important to take note that name, student number and phone number cannot have duplicates. Members of CCA can be deleted with the `delete` member command and can be edited with the `edit` member command. To look for member, you can use the `find` member function. The instructions on how you can use the commands are listed below. To show all members, you can use the `list` member function.

### Add Member
To start, you can populate the member list of **CCA Manager** with the help of the `add` member command. This command lets you key in necessary information such as your members' particulars

* `add /m` This adds entries to the Member List stored in CCA Manager.
    * The `add /m` keyword requires 4 different arguments:
        * use `/n` to input _name_ of your member. 
          * ⚠️ Member name of each entry must be _unique_. Different member entries with the same member name are not allowed.
          * ⚠️ Member name can only have letters and spaces. Anything else will be rejected.
        * use `/s` to input _student number_ of your member.
          * ⚠️ Student Number of each entry must be _unique_. Different member entries with the same student number are not allowed.
          * ⚠️ Student Number must start with A, then 7 numbers and ends with any letters.
        * use `/g` to input _gender_ of your member. Either _M_ for male or _F_ for female.
        * use `/p` to input _phone number_ of your member.
          * ⚠️ Phone number of each entry must be _unique_. Different member entries with the same phone number are not allowed.
          * ⚠️ Phone number must be a Singapore phone number that starts with 9 or 8 and have only 8 digits.
   
    * **Format:**
      * `add /m [/n MEMBER_NAME] [/s STUDENT_NUMBER] [/g GENDER] [/p PHONE NUMBER]`

    * **Examples:**
      * `add /m /n John Hwee /s A0248192K /g M /p 91128888`
    
    * **Expected Output:**
   ```
   Added a Member: 
   [1] Name: JOHN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888
   ```
   
   * **Expected Output for duplicate member:**
    ```
    Error when adding member:
        Duplicate name found. Please enter a different name
    ```
    
### Delete Member
If one of your CCA members has quit, or your senior has graduated, you can remove their entry from **CCA Manager** to keep your member list up to date.

* `delete /m` This deletes entries from the Member list in **CCA Manager**.
   * The `delete /m` keyword can delete entries using either of two different prompts: _index_ or _name_
     * You can delete member entries by inputting the `index` of the member.
     * You can also delete member entries by inputting the `name` of the member.
       * If there are *two or more* members with the same name, **CCA Manager** will display these members and their indexes and prompt you to delete the member you want using his/her index.
   * **Format:**
     * `delete [/m MEMBER_INDEX_NUMBER]`
     * `delete [/m MEMBER_NAME]`
   * **Examples:**
     * `delete /m 1` Deletes the first member on the member list.
     * `delete /m John` Deletes a member with the name 'John'.
       * If unable to find a direct match to the name, similar names with John in them will be shown so that you can specify the full name of the person you want to delete. 
       _To avoid this error, you may want to key in the full name of your memebers!_
   
   * **Expected Output:**
   
   ```
    You have removed member: 
    [1] Name: JOHN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888
   ```

### List Member
**CCA Manager** allows you to list out all the recorded members in your member list.

* `list /m` This lists out entries in CCA Manager's Member List.
   * The `list /m` keyword is strict, meaning that it must follow the above format. E.g. `list /m RANDOM` will not be a valid command.
   * `list /m` will also show you the `index` of the members that will be helpful for other commands.
   * **Format:** 
     * `list /m`
   * **Examples:**
     * `list /m`
   * **Expected Output:**
     ```
     [1] Name: JOHN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888
     [2] Name: LOREM IPSUM | Student Number: A1231234B | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91118888
     [3] Name: FRANK HAN | Student Number: A1234567Z | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91234567   
     ```
   
### Edit Member
Oh, no! You were careless, and you accidentally keyed in John's name wrongly! Worry not; if you have to perform minor changes to your member entries, **CCA Manager** allows you to edit your member entries by using the edit function.
This means that you will not have to delete the entry and then add a new one later on.

* `edit /m` This edits an existing entry from the member list
    * Entries are referenced using their index
    * `/m <MEMBER_INDEX_NUMBER>` edits the member detail stored at the given index. The index is a **compulsory** field.
      * The below fields are on a fill-per-case basis. Only fill in the fields that need changing.
      * `/n <NEW_MEMBER_NAME>` edits the current member _name_
      * `/s <NEW_PHONE_NUMBER>` edits the current _student number_
      * `/g <NEW_GENDER>` edits the current _gender_
      * `/p <NEW_PHONE_NUMBER>` edits the current _phone number_
    * **Format:**
      * `edit [/m MEMBER_INDEX_NUMBER] [/n NEW_MEMBER_NAME] [/s NEW_STUDENT_NUMBER] [/g NEW_GENDER] [/p NEW_PHONE_NUMBER]`
    * **Examples:**
      * `edit /m 1 /n Juan Hwee` Change only the name of the first entry to JUAN HWEE
      * `edit /m 3 /n 91112222` Change the phone number of the 3rd entry to 91112222
    
    * **Expected Output:**
    
   ```
   Edited member: 
   [1] Name: JOHN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888
   To become:  
   [1] Name: JUAN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888

   To become:  
   [3] Name: FRANK HAN | Student Number: A1234567Z | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91112222
   ```
### Find Member
**CCA Manager** allows you to search for a specific member by typing in a _keyword_ with the find function.

* `find` Searches for members based on the keyword given.
   * The keyword should be related to the name of the member
   * `/m <MEMBER_NAME_KEYWORD>` finds ALL entries with the MEMBER_NAME_KEYWORD in it.
     * For example, if you type `find /m jon`, `JON TAN` and `JON BOVI` will be found, but `JOHN LIM` will not be matched
   * The keyword is not case-sensitive
   * **Format:**
     * `find [/m MEMBER_NAME_KEYWORD]`
   * **Examples:**
     * `find /m juan`
     * `find /m lorem`
   * **Expected Output:**
   
   ```
   The following members matches your search "juan"
   [1] Name: JUAN HWEE | Student Number: A0248192K | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91128888
   
   The following members matches your search "lorem"
   [2] Name: LOREM IPSUM | Student Number: A1231234B | Gender: M | Phone Number: 91118888
   ```


## Training Commands
### Add Training
**CCA Manager** can help add trainings to your training list with the help of the `add /t` command.

* `add /t` This adds entries to the Training List stored in CCA Manager.
    * The `add /t` keyword requires 3 different arguments:
        * use `/n` to input _name_ of your training schedule.
          * ⚠️ Training Schedules must have _unique_ names. Different training entries with the same training name is not allowed.
        * use `/a` to input _date and time_ of your training schedule.
          * _Date and time_ is stored as a _String_ to allow the CCA admin to use relative timing. E.g. _After training_, _Recess Week_, etc.
        * use `/v` to input _venue_ of training schedule.
        * ⚠️ In your command input, there should only be ONE of each fields. Additional instances of the field will be treated as a wrong command, thus printing an error.
          * For example, `add /t /n Friday /n Training /a 5 Nov 2021 /v MPSH1` will produce an error, because `/n` is used twice.

    * **Format:**
        * `add /t [/n TRAINING_NAME] [/a TRAINING_TIME] [/v TRAINING_VENUE]`

    * **Examples:**
        * `add /t /n Weekly Friday Training 1 /a 5 Nov 2021 /v MPSH 1`
        * `add /t /n Weekly Friday Meeting /a After Training /v CCA Clubroom`
        * `add /t /n Weekly Friday Training 2 /a 12 Nov 2021 /v MPSH1`

    * **Expected Output:**

   ```
   Added a Training entry:
   [1] Training Name: WEEKLY FRIDAY TRAINING 1 | Venue: MPSH 1 | Time: 5 NOV 2021
   
   Added a Training entry:
   [2] Training Name: WEEKLY FRIDAY MEETING | Venue: CCA CLUBROOM | Time: AFTER TRAINING
   
   Added a Training entry:
   [3] Training Name: WEEKLY FRIDAY TRAINING 2 | Venue: MPSH 1 | Time: 12 NOV 2021
   ```

### Delete Training
You can delete any existing training schedules with the help of the `delete` command.

* `delete /t` This delete entries from the training list in **CCA Manager**.
    * The `delete /t` keyword can delete entries using either of two different prompts: index or name
        * You can delete training entries by inputting the `index` of the training.
        * You can also delete training entries by inputting the `name` of the training.
            * If there are *two or more* trainings with the same name, **CCA Manager** will display these trainings and their indexes and prompt you to delete the training you want using his/her index.
    * **Format:**
        * `delete [/t TRAINING_INDEX_NUMBER]`
        * `delete [/t TRAINING_NAME]`
    * **Examples:**
        * `delete /t 1` Deletes the first training on the training list.
        * `delete /t Friday` Deletes a training with the name 'John'.
            * If there is more than 1 Friday in the training list, a prompt will show up, and you will need to delete the 'Friday' based on its index number.
    * **Expected Output:**
    
   ```
   You have removed training entry:
   [1] Training Name: WEEKLY FRIDAY TRAINING 1 | Venue: MPSH 1 | Time: 5 NOV 2021
   
   Below are the possible matches. Please key in the INDEX NUMBER ONLY to delete

   ```

### List Training
**CCA Manager** allows you to list out all the recorded trainings.

* `list /t` This lists out entries in CCA Manager's Training List.
    * The `list /t` keyword is strict, meaning that it must follow the above format. E.g. `list /t TRAININGABC` will not be a valid command.
    * `list /t` will also show you the `index` of the trainings that will be helpful for other commands.
    * **Format:**
        * `list /t`
    * **Examples:**

* `edit /t` This edits an existing entry from the training list
    * Entries are referenced using their index
    * `/t <TRAINING_INDEX_NUMBER>` edits the training detail stored at the given index. The index is a **compulsory** field.

        * `/a <NEW_TRAINING_TIME>` edits the current _date and time_
        * `/v <NEW_TRAINING_VENUE>` edits the current _venue_
        * ⚠️ Similar to [Add Member](#add-member), the edit field should only have **one** of each field (`/n`, `/a` or `/v`). Otherwise, the command will be treated as invalid. 

    * **Format:**
        * `edit [/t TRAINING_INDEX_NUMBER] [/n NEW_TRAINING_NAME] [/a NEW_TRAINING_TIME] [/v NEW_TRAINING_VENUE]`
    * **Examples:**
        * `edit /t 1 /v MPSH2` Updates the venue of Index 1 to MPSH2

### FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

**Q**: Where can I find the file that my data is stored on?<br />
**A**: Members data are stored in `CCAMembers.csv` and Trainings data are stored in `CCATrainings.csv`. These two files are found in the same folder location as your `CCAManager.jar`.<br />

Attendance data are stored in a sub-folder called `Attendance`. There, the filename of your data is the Training Name of the attendance. The `Attendance` subfolder is found in the same folder location as your `CCAManager.jar`.


**Q**: It appears that I can input String data into the `date/time` field of Training data. Is this intentional?<br />
**A**: Yes, it is a feature. This is to support the use of relative date/time addressing, such as `After next meeting` or `Recess week`, for example. <br />This gives more flexibility to the user to store training data for trainings that may not have a set date currently. 
<br />However, a side effect is that gibberish String such as `ABCABC` or `DUMMYTEXT` can be stored in the `date/time` field, which is discouraged.

## Storage
CCA Manager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any commands that changes the data.
There is no need to save manually.
It is recommended that the CSV file be opened and edited with Microsoft Excel if absolutely necessary.

⚠ Please refrain from editing the data directly from the CSV file.
However, if you do so the program is able to run fine if the data changes are valid.
Else, the program will terminate. You should make sure all data is valid before trying to run the
program again.

⚠ Do not use commas when manually editing the CSV file.It might cause unintended errors in the program.

⚠ No blank lines should be left between entries when editing in Microsoft Excel.This will lead to data verification failing and program will terminate, 
citing invalid fields.

⚠ Do not rename or move the CSV files.
