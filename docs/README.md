# PayMeBack

PayMeBack is a CLI-based expense tracker for a group of friends travelling overseas together.

In such a group, it is easier for an individual to pay for expenses on behalf of the group rather than having each individual pay for their share for every activity. At the end of the day, it is quite troublesome to manually calculate how much money each individual owes to another. PayMeBack is designed to make this process easy and fuss-free, by helping you calculate how much each person owes every other person.
