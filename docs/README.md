# Mint

Mint is an all-in-one money managing app that helps you track your daily expenses, set budgets and long term financial
goals(coming soon). It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI).

As our team comprises university students, we hope that we can help fellow young adults in keeping track of their
finances.
