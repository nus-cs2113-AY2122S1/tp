# MedBot

MedBot is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for head nurses to manage patients’ personal and medical
information. By utilising text-based commands instead of traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) based navigation,
MedBot can allow head nurses to get their management tasks done quicker and more efficiently.
