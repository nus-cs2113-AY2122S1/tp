Food-O-Rama is a food wastage tracking application for restaurant owners and hawkers to 
keep track of their food resources. It provides the user with insight on the amount of ingredients 
in their storage and how much food is wasted. This allows the user to better plan their 
purchase of raw ingredients and enables more efficient allocation to the cooking of dishes which ultimately saves cost.

We at the Food-O-Rama team take pride in what we aim to do; help to reduce the global food wastage one step at a time.
