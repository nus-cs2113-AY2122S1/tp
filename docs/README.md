# Accouminate

Many university students are developing into independent adults, but still lack the financial literacy required. They will often spend too much in the first half of the month, leaving little to none for the rest of the month. 

Some others will get by month after month, as they spent a lot of their money on unnecessary wants without contributing to their savings.

This application will enable students to take charge of their finances by keeping track of their daily expenses, setting both short-term and long-term financial goals, and maintaining their investment records.

The overwhelming GUI of commercial budgeting applications might discourage potential users. The need to learn every aspect of the application, as well as how to navigate through the GUI, means that users have less time to use the app and need to spend more on mastering it. 

By simplifying and condensing the most essential parts of a budgeting app into a CLI-app, users can get the most out of their time. Computer Science students are especially adept at using the CLI, due to their experiences on the command prompt/shell. This means that they will be able to get a lot done with very little actions required.

At the end of the day, Accouminate is the cherished companion for students, an unforgettable stepping stone to financial literacy.
