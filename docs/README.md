SEPlanner is a lightweight desktop application for Computer Engineering undergraduates from the National University of Singapore
to plan for their Student Exchange Program, optimised for use via Command Line Interface (CLI). If you are familiar with command line,
SEPlanner can streamline your planning process when compared to other Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps.
