Traveller is a command line interface (CLI) application that is designed to help holiday-makers plan 
their overseas holiday trips with ease. 
As the countries start to adapt to the post-COVID situation, 
the demand for such an application will increase among people who prefer CLI applications, possibly 
due to a CLI applicationâ€™s simplicity and speed of use.
Traveller has many functionalities, such as finding optimal flights to your desired destination, 
and creating multiple itineraries with an agenda for each day of your trip.
