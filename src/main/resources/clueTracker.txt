I went to the room and asked my father to have
lunch. He hurriedly put away the paper on his
hand. I recognized it from the perspective of
my soul that it was a few insurance documents.
It seemed that my father bought insurance for
our family members a few years ago, amount
insured more than ten thousand.

Father received a call and I vaguely overheard,
"You are in charge of finance, and you know
the situation...Reassure the colleagues first...
The salary will definitely come next month...
I'm really not free today, I'll be there tomorrow,
and I'll do what they said".

Father received text messages on his cell phone 
for several days in a row, and the contents were 
all the same: "Li Jianguo, owe money pay money. 
Don't try to hide from us. You can't escape."

There was an old diary on my father's desk, one
of which had a newly opened crease.

"Last night, the party between our two families
 was really crazy, especially my wife, who had
been idle for a whole year after giving birth to
 our child. She was drunk last night and still
didn't wake up... Of course... I was a little
drunk. When I woke up this morning, asleep
besides me was... I thought it was my wife... We
 didn't remember what happened. Fortunately,
my and her husband drank even more and woke up
than us. They didn't know anything. Let everyone
forget all this and treat it as a dream..."

Father went out halfway. It sounded like there
were some quarrel outside.
As my soul approached the door, I vaguely heard
my father's voice - "if it weren't for the 
child's physical examination, the blood type
wouldn't match your husband and wife, who would
have thought it was my seed!" "forget it, the
child doesn't know? Well, Xiao Mo doesn't know.
Let's hide it first. Well, I know, we'll find a
way about the two children."

There was a crumpled paper in Father's bedroom,
which vaguely revealed a line of words "... The
paternity appraisal value between Li Jianguo and
the appraiser was calculated to be 99.9999%."

When Wendy was using the bathroom, Kevin said
to me with a complicated look, "Chris, we've
known each other for so many years. You're a

According to the financial report at the table,
Father's company failed to bid for the White
Dolphin project and the capital chain was
seriously broken. Alpha took the opportunity
to acquire a large number of shares. Without
financial support, the company's prospects are
worrying.

The latest page of my father's diary says: Alpha
Company is a devil's company. No one has a good
end, no matter its opponent or partner...
Fortunately, my son was ambitious and didn't want
to come to our company. He went out and avoided
this mess... But... Can he really escape in the
same industry?

There is a plate of Mapo Tofu in the refrigerator.
It looks like it was just made by my father. The
surface is a little messy. I don't know why it
wasn't served to the table.

When I went to the bathroom, Kevin and Wendy
quietly bowed their heads and said something.
From the perspective of soul, they vaguely heard
words such as "he knows... Alpha... Bribe...

There was a new message flashing on the mobile
