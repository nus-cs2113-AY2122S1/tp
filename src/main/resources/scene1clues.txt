I went to the room and asked my father to have
lunch. He hurriedly put away the paper on his
hand. I recognized it from the perspective of
my soul that it was a few insurance documents.
It seemed that my father bought insurance for
our family members a few years ago, amount
insured more than ten thousand.

Father received a call and I vaguely overheard,
"You are in charge of finance, and you know
the situation...Reassure the colleagues first...
The salary will definitely come next month...
I'm really not free today, I'll be there tomorrow,
and I'll follow they said".

Father received text messages on his cell phone 
for several days in a row, and the contents were 
all the same: "Li Jianguo, owe money pay money. 
Don't try to hide from us. You can't escape."
